## 3.0.0
### General Changes
- Migrated to esbuild bundling for improved load times by cutting down on successive HTTP requests.
    - Source maps provided for debugging
- Keybinding now route or pseudo-route through UI control handlers for consistant behavior (fixes [issue #26](https://github.com/henry-malinowski/raise-my-hand-plus/issues/26))

### Overhauled Settings system
- *Technical:* Settings are now stored in [`DataModels`](https://foundryvtt.com/api/classes/foundry.abstract.DataModel.html); reducing API calls to `game.setting.get` and enabling better migration support if/when it's needed in the future
- Rich popout menus for settings that are progressively discovered; only showing currently relevant settings. 
- Generally more customization is possible without additional cognitive load.
- Changing Hand or X-Card settings no longer requires reloading Foundry. *Hooray!* 🥳
- Settings now have a "Reset \[to defaults\]" button

### Notification Changes
- Notifications with scope set to "GM only", now always show for the triggering user as feedback that the notification was sent

### Player List Changes
- Right clicking a name to get the user context options offers another way to lower hands
    - A player can right-click their own name to lower their hand
    - A GM can use right-click any user's name to lower that user's hand
- The Player List hand now has animations and improvements to visibility and two modes
    - When toggle mode is enabled, it works like the original style
    - When not in toggle mode, the hand appears, and goes away after an adjustable duration

### Scene Control Changes
- Hand Raiser button is removed when no Hand notification modes are enabled
- Raise Hand and X-Card buttons now have toolclips; featuring a demonstration of the action and an abbreviation of the current notification settings
