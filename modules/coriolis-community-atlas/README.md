# Coriolis Community Atlas Foundry Module

Welcome to the Coriolis Community Atlas Foundry module.

## Content

This module is an adaptation of the Coriolis Community Atlas published under the Free League Workshop program as a Pay What You Want resource.

It contains journal entries and scenes for all of the stat systems described in the atlas.

## How to install the content

After you have installed this module, all of the journal entries and scenes are located in two compendiums: one for the journal entries and one for the scenes.

You can import the scenes and journal entries from the compendium using the Import All Content option.

!! Don’t forget to check the Keep Document IDs so that notes in the scenes references the correct journal entries.

Welcome to the Third Horizon!
