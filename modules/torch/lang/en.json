For these, using a light source decreases its quantity by one.</p><p>For systems that have no inventory-based light sources configured, you can configure light sources through module settings. In this case, all actors get the same light source.</p><p>You can make a system recognized by supplying a JSON file of light sources, as described in the README.md.</p><p>If you have multiple light sources in your inventory, you can choose among them by right-clicking the Torch button on the HUD when you do not have a light source lit.</p>"
