Her handling of the Mysticides only made her even more liked by her superiors and among the Zenithian establishment, and as the judiciary world’s new golden child, there was talk of her being given the role of court president and maybe one day a seat at the Council. The only fly in the ointment was the rumor about her son Arlain being infected with the mystic’s disease, which — if proven true — would seriously derail her career. The taint springs from the Firstcome corruption in the dark between the stars and true Zenithians simply don’t catch the disease.</p><p>Denouncing her son was one of the hardest things she has ever done and although it gave her career room to blossom again, it robbed her of the most important family relationship of her adult life.
