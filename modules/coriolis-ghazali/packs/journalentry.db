After the collapse of the portal to Taoan, it becomes almost forgotten. </span><br/><br/><p><strong>The hamurabi station</strong> is still visited now and then by traders, but the luxury cruises from Coriolis to Dabaran stop, and so does the business they brought with them. The system instead becomes a highly militarized no-man’s land, where the fleets of the Order and the Legion go to flex their muscles.</p><h2>Planets</h2><p>The system contains only three planets, one of which – Nestero – is a massive gas giant. Nestero has a strange, close orbit around the Hamura star, with the smaller planets Hamura and Yublai on longer orbits farther out. The system is known for its violent ion storms and for its infamous corsair captain, Samina. The Hamurabi portal station orbits the star between the two portals at about ½ AD from both the star and the portals.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Nestero</h3><p>The Foundation have been studying Nestero for many years to try to explain how the mysterious gas giant can have such a close orbit around its star – gas giants are otherwise found far from the center of their home systems. It is believed that some form of portal-related phenomenon might explain its orbit, and research teams arrive regularly on Hamurabi to undertake dangerous survey expeditions. Nestero has thirteen moons, of which the Abui ice moon is the most widely known. The Colonial Agency runs a mine on Abui where hired hands work long, dangerous shifts mining ice.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Hamura</h3><p>The planet with the same name as the system is mostly covered in vast oceans. A string of hundreds of thousands of tiny islands can be found along the equator. The gravity effects produced by the relationship between Hamura and her three moons create gigantic tides every four days, with ebb and flow differences of up to a hundred meters. Terrifying storms are common. Hamura is a popular cruise destination thanks to its rich marine fauna and the high concentration of minerals in its water. Its oceans are marketed as “the Horizon’s most natural spa experience,” and well-off people from near and far come here to rest up or calm down. The planet’s only large settlement, Dome Isolda, owes much of its economy to tourism, with underwater cruises departing weekly for distant paradise islands and reefs inhabited by extraordinarily beautiful marine life.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Yublai</h3><p>Yublai is a dark reflection of its sister planet Hamura – covered in boiling lava. Peculiar activity in the planet’s core constantly transports lava to the surface. The volcanic activity also produces a valuable gas, named Bwalya after the discovering prospector. The Agency have made repeated attempts to mine the gas, most recently using ED technology to funnel the gas through the atmosphere up to low-orbit space stations. Technical difficulties have forced them to shut down four of the project’s six stations, and the remaining two are only used for data gathering. The most remote installation, station Gupta, has been claimed as home base by Samina’s dreaded corsairs.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/the hamura system/hamura_systemet.webp\"/></div><h2>Traveling In Hamura</h2><p>Ion storms and corsairs make the Hamura system more dangerous than one might think. Pages 138–140 in the Coriolis core rulebook detail space travel in the Third Horizon. To the right is a list of events for travel in the Hamura system, but they can quite easily be converted to work in other systems as well.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 3 Events In The Hamura System</h4><p>@RollTable[Events In The Hamura System]</p><table><thead><tr><th>D6</th><th>EVENT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Ion Storm</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Nomads</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Distress Call (Fake)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Distress Call (Real)</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Derelict Ship</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>The Lighthouse Keeper</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Ion Storm</h3><p>The sensors suddenly go wild, red lights begin to flash, and the bridge is filled with loud beeps and whines. The PCs have entered one of the dreaded Hamura ion storms. They get no indication of what is coming and may not attempt to avoid it. Flashing, multichromatic lights flicker and dance across their hull. The pilot may attempt to navigate through as quickly and safely as possible by testing pilot at –2. Failure results in the ship suffering a strength 4 attack (weapon damage 1, CRIT 3) dealing EP damage. Each player must roll a D6. On a roll of one, the person is electrocuted by a nearby overload (strength 3 attack, weapon damage 2, CRIT (shock)).</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Nomads</h3><p>A group of nomads hail the PCs to see if they would be interested in bartering or trading information. They are scavengers from the Odacon system traveling in three class IV salvage ships (equivalent of the @Actor[Kamruk - Salvage Model] on page 159 of the Coriolis core rulebook) and have their haul in a huge net in tow. The leader, Keita, is very hospitable and invites the PCs over to share a festive meal – dhol barbecue (spit-roast prairie dog) and fire kohol. During the dinner, the following might happen:</p><ul><li>Andili Teko, the nomads’ Abba (seer), sits down next to one of the PCs and offers to consult the deck about her future for the modest sum of 200 birr. You can use the Icon deck to create the prophecy.</li><li>Keita offers to barter with the PCs. He would prefer payment in advanced tech or luxuries, but will also accept birr. If the PCs win an opposed manipulation test, they may reduce the prices. The salvaged goods include:</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>SHIP PART</th><th>DEFECT</th><th>COST</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Thermal Cannon</td><td>Broken coolant system. TECHNOLOGY –1 to repair. Requires one advanced spare part.</td><td>55,000</td></tr><tr><td>Salvage Module</td><td>Responds slowly. Roll a D6 when used. On a one, 1 point of HP damage is inflicted on the ship being salvaged. Can only be repaired after the flaw has been discovered.

Requires one ordinary spare part.</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>Space Scooter</td><td>Broken thrusters. PILOT –2 until repaired. TECHNOLOLGY –1 to repair. One advanced spare part required.</td><td>70,000</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>A young girl travelling with the nomads has tired of life on the move. She sneaks onto the PCs’ ship just as they say their goodbyes to the nomads and hides in the cargo hold. It’s probably going to take a while before the PCs find her. Her name is Mirva and she has a knack for spaceship engines&hellip;</li></ul><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span>  Distress Call (Fake)</h3><p>The PCs are hailed by the courier vessel Khorint II requesting emergency assistance. The Khorint’s captain Radebe says that an explosion onboard has taken out their grav projector. The ship is dead in space, and needs towing and medical assistance. Radebe says that they are on their way to Dome Isolda on Hamura, but they are actually one of Samina’s corsair crews trying to trick the PCs. They wait until the PCs come close, fire a well-aimed acc volley, and attempt to board. They will pursue if the PCs try to run and won’t give up easily. The corsairs number five plus captain Radebe. The Khorint II is a standard courier model (page 142 of the Coriolis core rulebook @UUID[JournalEntry.z488484397472825.JournalEntryPage.6fcb51326e00fe22]{Create Your Ship}), owned by Ermes and registered on Caph in the Caph sytem (a successful data djinn test can inform the PCs of this). The corsairs have of course stolen the ship from Ermes, as it looks inconspicuous enough to fool careless travelers.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Distress Call (Real)</h3><p>The PCs receive a chaotic distress call from the cruise ship Afora – the captain is dead, the crew and the passengers are in bad shape and there are people shooting at each other onboard. The Afora had just departed Hamura when a firefight broke out. The stand-off is between Syndicate-affiliated smugglers and Consortium agents from Special Branch. The Rafa family have been running guns through the Taoan system for years, but Special Branch caught their scent a few segments back. The SB agents identified a smuggling ring on Hamura and figured out that they were using the luxury cruise ships to transport the weapons. When the smugglers on the Afora by chance noticed the agents on the ship, they panicked and opened fired. The Afora has been turned into a warzone, with the eight smugglers trying to kill the five SB agents, while the hundred-or-so passengers and crew risk getting caught in the crossfire. The PCs can dock with the Afora and board it without problem. The Afora looks much like the Ghazali, and the passengers and crew are holed up in the cantina. If the PCs help sort out the conflict (peacefully or otherwise), they are handsomely compensated (20,000 birr) by the Nigira cruise company and end up on the news across the Horizon.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Derelict Ship</h3><p>The PCs pick up a drifting spacecraft on their sensors, a class IV freighter named the Erasmus. It has been ripped open by a reactor explosion (weak radiation) and not even basic life support is online. The cause of the reactor failure is unclear from exterior scans. The horribly mangled bodies of the crew float around inside. The PCs can board and loot the ship should they want to, in which case they find a space scooter, two loader exos, some birr, and assorted personal items. The real treasure sits in the cargo hold, however: a large shipment of Magnena caviar worth almost 30,000 birr. The Magnena is a fish native to Hamura whose eggs are considered a delicacy in many places in the Horizon, especially on Dabaran. But what has happened to the Erasmus? A @Actor[Byara] (page 325 of the Coriolis core rulebook) got onboard the ship and killed the crew. In a final desperate act, captain Masinga caused the reactor overload, hoping to kill the creature even if it cost him his own life. Unfortunately, the byara survived and is still lurking in the dark interior of the ship&hellip;</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Lighthouse Keeper</h3><p>The PCs are hailed by the Serero space beacon, where ‘lighthouse keeper’ Majed Habsi leads a life of quiet solitude. He is eager for company and news from the Horizon. He invites the PCs to share a frugal meal with him and inquires if they have anything more savory on their ship to trade. His intentions for contacting them appear to be boredom and loneliness, but the truth behind his calm exterior is that the constant presence of the dark between the stars is getting to him. He waits for a good opportunity to strike and then makes a run for the PCs’ ship, wanting to escape his isolation. If they are unsuccessful at stopping him, they are trapped on the tiny station until another spacecraft comes their way. Majed doesn’t really have a plan, and when the PCs eventually escape the beacon, they can easily track him to Hamurabi where he has ditched their ship in favor of other means of transportation out into the Horizon&hellip;</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>Samina&rsquo;s Corsairs</h5><p>Samina’s corsairs are known across the entire Horizon and the Council have promised a 10,000 birr reward to anyone who can reveal their hideout to the authorities and bring Samina to justice. The hunt for Samina could easily be made into a thrilling mission for the PCs. The Azandra space station plan from the game box can be used as the corsair hideout.

Below is a list of events for the epilogue. As they wait for clearance to jump back to Kua, a lot can happen – read more on page 52 @UUID[JournalEntry.z107232760606558.JournalEntryPage.1fb5bbeafe3a17fc]{The Hamura System}.</p><h2>Arrival At Hamurabi</h2><p>The PCs’ ship arrives at the Hamurabi portal station. Three smaller vessels are docked already, but no ships appear to be in jump preparation. The dock’s manager replies straight away to their docking request and sends them a vector for Dock 11. If the PCs radio ahead to tell the port office about the fate of the Ghazali and about carrying badly irradiated passengers, they are promised that a medical team will be waiting at the docks when they land.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/epilogue/Hamurabistationen03_fri.webp\"/></div><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Welcoming Committee</h3><p>Port inspector Asal Harub – ever the bureaucrat – and two station guards are the first to greet the PCs as they dock. Asal has not been informed about the circumstances of their arrival regardless of whether they alerted the port office or not, and obnoxiously starts flicking through documents on his tabula to have them fill out all the correct paperwork before entering the station interior. The inspector’s annoying adherence to protocol might land him in trouble as the survivors are likely to be desperate for medical attention, but a team from the station’s medlab rushes in before things get out of hand and starts helping the wounded off the ship. Asal is shoved aside, loudly complaining about the triumph of anarchy over order – in his mind, the fact that no one informed him of the medical needs of the new arrivals trumps the fact that an enormous catastrophe has just occurred, practically in his own backyard. He demands to inspect every inch of the PCs’ ship to restore some of his sullied professional honor. Should he find Sabetha Pour’s cargo during his inspection, the PCs are in big trouble&hellip;</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Medlab</h3><p>Chief medicurg Lumara Akbion and her team follows the Life-Limb-Function-Aesthetics rule, initially focusing on saving as many lives as possible. Replacing lost limbs with prosthetics and other minor surgeries will have to wait.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Station Management And The Emerald Disc</h3><p>The PCs are called upon by station chief Rhavinn Bokor. He is interested in anything they can tell him about the Ghazali disaster, and will accept the emerald disc if they offer it to him. He can’t read it however, only the Colonial Agency can do that. The dynamic decryption on the disc is outside of his abilities to crack, even if he was allowed to try. If the PCs wish to hold on to the disc themselves, Rhavinn recommends that they bring it to the Agency headquarters on Coriolis as soon as possible, which is what he himself will do if it is entrusted to him.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Colonial Agency</h3><p>Shortly after their arrival on the station, the PCs are approached by Colonial Agent Yasintra Hur. She is also interested in their statement regarding the incident. She has a more direct, demanding demeanor than Akbar Bokor, and will insist that they hand over the emerald disc if she finds out that they have it. She intends to be the one to hand over the disc to her superiors to score political favors, and is willing to do a lot of things to see it through. If she finds the PCs uncooperative, she threatens to slander their involvement in the evacuation – which she could quite easily do, as she is friends with Anata Garam and several others at the Bulletin.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Bulletin</h3><p>The Bulletin is represented on the station by Anata Garam. She is very keen on interviewing the PCs, and would love to shoot a segment onboard the ship. Unless the PCs hide from her, she makes sure their faces and names are on every screen on Hamurabi and Coriolis over the next few days. Anata will try to dig up as much as possible about the PCs and their handling of the evacuation. If they acted foolishly or immorally during some situations on the Ghazali, she will most likely find out about it. If you want to put your players on the spot even more, she might even be able to find dirt on them from previous scenarios. The way they are portrayed in the Bulletin could heavily affect their Reputation scores (page 28 of the Coriolis core rulebook @UUID[JournalEntry.z411803786505911.JournalEntryPage.151a634ebf98da11#changing-your-reputation]{Changing Your Reputation}).</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Other News</h4><ul><li>The portal between the Hamura and Taoan systems was damaged during the incident and the Foundation have no prognosis about when (or even if) it will recover. This means that Dabaran is currently only reachable via Amedo and Melik. The Zafirah had completed the jump to Taoan when the portal exploded, and its fate remains unknown. Rumors about the Legion destroyer are not optimistic, and Legionnaires and their families are gathering at the chapels on the station to pray.</li><li>The Council of Factions have convened an emergency meeting, but the resulting actions are surprisingly weak. A small reconnaissance group is sent the long way around to investigate but it will take long time before any news is heard back from them.</li><li>After another week or so, reports arrive indicating that the portal between Uharu and Taoan fluctuates in a strange new pattern, effectively isolating the Taoan colony from the rest of the Horizon. The Legion and the Consortium rapidly try to fortify their hold on the Hamura portals, causing tension with both the Hegemony and the Order. The Order’s temple cruisers show up in Uharu and quickly disperse the small fleet of mercenary gunboats hired by the Consortium. Political tensions near a breaking point.</li><li>In the absence of news about the Taoan colony, the Bulletin returns to focusing its coverage on the second hottest topic: the conflict between the Consortium and the Order over passage through Zalos, closed by the Order after the heretical claims to divinity made by the Judge Emissary.</li></ul></div><h2>The Return To Coriolis</h2><p>The most likely course of action for the PCs at the end of the scenario is to jump back to Coriolis, which is an uneventful affair. Rhavinn Bokor provides jump coordinates free of charge if the PCs promise to deliver the news of Hamurabi’s dire medical shortages to the owners on Coriolis. The free space on the PCs’ ship will be hotly contested by the rest of the survivors, as they too wish to return to Coriolis. Economically minded PCs stand to make a quick fortune off of the competing passengers. Rhavinn Bokor tries to persuade the group to bring some of the worst cases with them as they have a better chance of surviving if they receive proper medical attention on Coriolis.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> In The Spotlight</h3><p>PCs who willingly submit to the massive media exposure that follows the disaster are invited to Dawn Hostess Nana Eliades’ talk show, recorded every morning at the Alkamaar restaurant at the top of the Spire on Coriolis. The interviewees are treated to all the luxuries of the famed establishment, including courtesans and specially imported delicacies. The show is seen by a fifth of the station’s population, and PCs who appear on the show become instantly recognizable in the streets, at least until the next big event comes along. If they go on the show, the PCs’ Reputation scores are raised or lowered by 1, depending on how their actions during the evacuation are portrayed. Most other news circulating on the station also concerns the Ghazali disaster.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Emerald Disc</h3><p>If the PCs retrieved the emerald disc, the time has come to pass it on to someone else. The group may have their reasons for wanting to deliver it to a factionary hotshot, but it isn’t important who ends up with the disc, at least not for this scenario. The disc is encrypted with the Colonial Agency’s dynamic cipher – a code constantly producing enormous amounts of new information, making it incredibly difficult and time-consuming to crack it without the key. If another faction initially gets hold of the disc, they will eventually sell it back to the Agency for promised support in future votes on the Council. If the PCs attempt to sell it to the Agency themselves, they will be offered the non-negotiable sum of 5,000 birr. If they hesitate, the agent they are meeting with will firmly say that this is the faction’s only and final offer – one they would be very wise to accept. If they refuse, the faction will turn to Special Branch (see page 190 of the Coriolis core rulebook @UUID[JournalEntry.z795188665481025.JournalEntryPage.3f1482ef9f532cf5]{The Consortium}), and highly trained agents will start stalking the PCs, ready to do whatever it takes to get the disc back. The emerald disc contains the following information, some of which may come into play later during the Mercy of the Icons campaign, and some that you as the GM can use to create your own scenarios:</p><ul><li><strong>The Portal Field</strong>: The Ghazali was hit by an energy pulse from the portal field when the Zafirah jumped. Detailed logs show that the blast occurred before the entire destroyer was through, which may indicate that parts of the Zafirah may still be in the Hamura system. A partially corrupted spectrum analysis of the portal field shows that the blast significantly altered the fluctuation patterns of the portal, on a scale previously unheard of.</li><li><strong>The Probes</strong>: The warning from the Zafirah came from three emergency probes fired from the aft of the ship before it was all the way through the portal. The destroyer suffered such catastrophic damage immediately upon entering the field that the emergency protocols were activated.</li><li><strong>The Zafirah’s Data Dump</strong>: A data dump of the Zafirah’s condition was included with the message on the probes. It is the hardest information to get out of the disc, and only available to the PCs through contacts within the Agency or the Legion. The logs show that the Zafirah suffered multiple hull breaches immediately upon entering the portal field. This took the grav projectors offline and damaged several critical systems, and the ensuing collapse of the portal field tore the ship in half. This resulted in a reactor overload only seconds later and decompression in several sections. The most mysterious piece of information in the logs is that the destroyer evidently suffered damage before the portal field blast. If this is shared with the Agency, they will begin investigating the incident as a terrorist attack, with the Order of the Pariah as their prime suspects.</li></ul><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Fatima&rsquo;s Bounty</h3><p>The owner of Fatima’s Bounty, aging skipper Ninia Skados, perished along with the Ghazali. Her sickly widower, Radavan Skados, thus inherited the ship but has no interest in becoming a free trader – he is perfectly content with his life at a Legion Veterans’ home where he spends his days playing shah and bragging about his heroism on Uharu. To afford continuing his lifestyle (previously paid for by his wife), he might be inclined to let the PCs have the Bounty (“She would have wanted youngsters like you to have it”) in exchange for a contractual obligation to pay Radavan’s modest living expenses (To make it simple, this sum has been included in the Bounty’s service costs below). The contract is to be signed with Legion lawyers present as witnesses, and the faction will make sure the PCs hold up their end of the deal. If the PCs attempt to claim the ship as theirs without contacting the authorities, they will soon run into trouble. The ship is registered to Ninia Skados, which will show as soon as someone scans their transponder signal.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Stats For Fatima&rsquo;s Bounty</h4><p>Fatima’s Bounty is a medium freighter of the Omrik model.</p><table><thead><tr><th>STATS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Energy Points: 5</td></tr><tr><td>Hull Points: 6</td></tr><tr><td>MANEUVERABILITY: –1</td></tr><tr><td>SIGNATURE: 0</td></tr><tr><td>ARMOR: 5</td></tr><tr><td>SPEED: 2</td></tr><tr><td>MODULES: Accelerator Cannon, Docking Module, Hangar, Cabins (Standard), Cabins (Suite), Chapel, Cargo Module X5, Cargo Module X2, Medlab, Countermeasure Dispenser, Escape Pods, Unused Module Space X2, Stasis Module, Workshop</td></tr><tr><td>FEATURES: Atmospheric entry, Robust hull, Bonus modules x2 (for a total of 23 modules)</td></tr><tr><td>EXTRA GEAR: None</td></tr><tr><td>PROBLEM: Curse</td></tr><tr><td>COST: 1,652,500 birr</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/epilogue/frihandlare2.webp\"/></div><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Sabetha Pour&rsquo;s Sensitive Cargo</h3><p>You are free to let your players explore the mystery surrounding Sabetha Pour’s contraband as you please.

Read or act out the following:</p><p><em>Echoes from the past, voices speaking about the important task ahead. Captain Ia Kaschares: “The Tsurabi colony has sent us a distress call and we are part of the response team. What we expect to find after the jump to Taoan is not clear – well, you’ve all heard the message. We are being escorted by a Legion destroyer, the Zafirah, and we make the jump immediately after her.”</em></p><p><em>Colonial agent Nakifa continues: “The Tsurabi colony is a gas mine orbiting the system’s largest planet, the gas giant Taoan. About three hundred colonists, mainly miners plus a few scientists. Since we’re going in blind, no orders have been issued. Sensor sweeps will tell us more when we get there.”</em></p><p><em>The captain again: “All non-essential personnel are to go on ice immediately and sleep their way to Hamura. The Icons are with us – the Deckhand smiles in the bed next to you and the Traveler keeps watch from the bridge as we jump. See you in Taoan. Sleep tight.”</em></p><p><em>The urgency of the present: Flashing red and white lights, blaring sirens, heavy heads and unresponsive limbs. You must have come out of stasis too soon, and this is the infamous thawing nausea. Infamous for good reason.</em></p><p><em>No orders, no updates – just the cold floor underneath your feet and bodies reluctant to move. Your fingers remember the code to the locker with your personal effects and you clumsily put your gear on – no weapons, of course, those are kept up on the bridge.</em></p><p><em>You look around at each other – all frozen and stiff, squinting in the faint light. Still no orders, no updates – nothing. Stasis beds stacked in rows around you. About thirty team members went to sleep here – why are you the only ones awake? One of you asks for more light in a hoarse voice, but nothing happens. You call out to the central computer, but get no answer. You look at each other, at the spiral staircase climbing upward into the dark, and at the flashing white pulses in the red light strips along the floor.</em></p><p><em>Emergency lighting.<br>Emergency.</em></p><p>The PCs wake up surrounded by humming stasis pods, with heavy heads from the cryo sleep.</p><h2>The Situation</h2><p>The PCs and two dozen other rescue workers went on ice in a section containing sixty beds divided between four chambers. The PCs are in the deepest chamber, which has saved their lives – the sleepers in the chambers above are all dead (from the radiation). Many of the deceased clutch Icon talismans – a deckhand tradition when going on ice. Show the PCs the picture of the Ghazali, and show them which section of the ship they are in. Apart from a vague memory of where their ship is docked, they know nothing else of the ship. They will have to start exploring the ship to find their bearings.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>Weapons</h5><p>The PCs were not supposed to bring weapons onboard, and any they brought along anyway were locked away on the bridge. They might have been able to hide a weapon on their person, however. If they pass an INFILTRATION test, they have managed to stash a weapon, so long as it has the weapon features Light or Small.</p></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Finding Weapons</h4><p>If the PC didn’t smuggle weapons onboard (see above), they might want to get hold of something to defend themselves with as they leave the stasis chamber. A successful FORCE test allows them to rip a steel pipe from the wall to use as a club (Gear Bonus +1, INIT 0, weapon damage 1, CRIT 3, Close range). Clever PCs might try to find a power tool instead, by searching the crates of mining gear (dura drill, thermal lance or equivalent – Gear Bonus 0, INIT 0, weapon damage 2, CRIT 2, Close range).</p></div><h2>The Stasis Chamber</h2><p>The chamber is faintly illuminated by the red emergency lighting, but brighter light shines in from above where a spiral staircase leads up to more chambers. The room is a simple construction of metal and rubber, without any of the upper decks’ luxurious fittings. At the top of the stairs, after passing four identical chambers, an automatic door opens and closes on a dark corridor. The PCs’ personal effects can be found in the lockers at the foot of the stasis beds. All weapons they brought aboard are kept on the bridge, however.</p><h2>Important Facts</h2><p>Passing a medicurgy test can reveal that the other rescue workers in this section have been killed by radiation poisoning. The PCs must exit the stasis chambers to find out more about what has happened. Attempts to contact the ship’s computer via the intercom system fail. A successful data djinn test can tell them that they must find a working terminal to contact the ship’s intelligence. All the terminals they pass seem to be broken, however.</p></div></div></div>"},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"coriolis-ghazali":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/02 - Act 1 - Emergency","noteRef":""},"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true}}},{"_id":"bd395c24f8d891bf","name":"Through Darkness","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"entryBGVTT\"><div class=\"entryContainer\"><div class=\"entryContent\"><p>The PCs make their way through the ship searching for more information and other survivors.</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>The ship was badly damaged when the portal field collapsed.

The corridors and chambers are all dimly lit by the red emergency lights. Stasis pods and crates of equipment are stacked high everywhere. The stasis beds are either unoccupied, or contain dead rescue workers. Small doors and hatches connect to maintenance ducts where the air is humid, and condensation drips from the ceiling. Foul smells circulate through the barely working ventilation systems. Some of the larger rooms contain vehicles in varying states of disassembly – mainly crawlers and loaders, together with few light scout vehicles. The smell of the exhaust fumes still lingers. The rubber floors and metal walls are painted in a matte, grayish green. Ductwork and cables hang from the ceiling. Everything is relatively worn-down, the rubber floors are scratched and the wall paint chipped. There are plenty of dark corners and crevasses to hide in, should the PCs feel so inclined.</p><h2>NPCs</h2><p>Below is a description of the NPCs the PCs might encounter in the scene.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">Lahor Iades, Irradiated Stevedore</div>@Actor[Lahor Iades, Irradiated Stevedore]<div class=\"blueheader\">Desperate, Sick, Rescue Workers</div><ul><li>@Actor[Gemenas]</li><li>@Actor[Ylaria]</li><li>@Actor[Tabrak]</li><li>@Actor[Karel]</li><li>@Actor[Shanaz]</li></ul><h2>Events</h2><p>Below is a list of events for you to use during the PCs’ search for a working terminal. Some of them require DP to activate.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Broken Terminal</h3><p>The PCs pass a broken terminal. It is either just dark and dead, or the display is so distorted that nothing can be read off it. The speakers hiss with static.<br><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 DP</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Fire</h3><p>A corridor or module has caught fire. If the PCs try to pass through the fire, they suffer a Fire 3 attack (weapon damage 1, CRIT 1. See Fire on page 97 of the Coriolis core rulebook @UUID[JournalEntry.z151543463005475.JournalEntryPage.954b55bb8afaf0fe#fire]{Fire}). Alternatively, they can turn around and look for another way. Unless the fire is put out, there is a risk of it spreading to nearby sections.<br><strong>Cost</strong>: 1 DP</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Radiation</h3><p>The PCs enter an area with higher levels of lingering radiation. Parts of the ceiling have collapsed ahead of them and block their way. White fumes leak out of ruptured tubes. If they remain here, they suffer 1 point of radiation per minute. Let the PC with the highest survival score test to spot the danger. Success means being alerted to the radiation. Failure means immediately suffering 1 RP. They can either try to push their way through the debris or turn around. Quickly pushing through the dangerous area requires either a force or a dexterity test. Failure means suffering 2 RPs, success means only 1 RP.<br><strong>Cost</strong>: 1 DP</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Explosive Decompression</h3><p>The PCs suddenly hear the hull creaking and sighing nearby. A successful observation or science test can tell them what is about to happen – the wall is about to give way and expose them to the vacuum of space! The automated security systems quickly lock all bulkhead doors around them. See the adjacent box for rules on explosive decompression. Those who passed the observation or science test get a +2 to their subsequent force or dexterity rolls. See page 99 of the Coriolis core rulebook @UUID[JournalEntry.z151543463005475.JournalEntryPage.954b55bb8afaf0fe#vacuum]{Vacuum} for the rules on vacuum exposure. Fortunately, this section contains an exo locker.<br><strong>Cost</strong>: 1 DP</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Explosive Decompression</h4><p>When the hull is breached in a section, all nearby loose objects are violently sucked toward the hole. If you wish to move as the section is decompressing, test DEXTERITY at –2. Just grabbing onto something steady requires a FORCE test at –1. Both tests are slow actions. If you are wearing an exo, the tests are without penalties. A critical success can be used to rescue a comrade that failed her roll, or to catch an object within Close range (FORCE) or Short range (DEXTERITY). These rules can also be used during space combat and in firefights near weak points in the hull.</p></div><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Victims Of The Nekatra</h3><p>The sickening smell of blood and death is heavy in the corridor ahead. At an intersection further ahead, the PCs find four horribly mutilated bodies. Paw prints in the blood trail lead off in several directions. If the PCs loot the bodies, they find a personal communicator, a transactor with 840 birr, and a tool belt containing a set of ordinary tools as well as a hydro spanner (blunt instrument). A group of nekatra have escaped their cages and roam the Ghazali. They are part of the Legion escort, but were placed on the Ghazali as the Zafirah was full. After waking up without their handlers to take care of them, the pack let their primal instincts take over – to hunt, maim, and kill. Read more about @Actor[Nekatra] on page 316 of the Coriolis core rulebook.</p><p>The encounter with the nekatra has been divided into several parts to increase the suspense. The first encounter is the PCs finding the dead bodies described above. They can also hear faint growling nearby. Encountering the nekatra themselves comes later, and will likely end in violence – but depending on the PCs’ actions, things might turn out differently. When finding the mangled corpses, a survival test can reveal what has happened here, and tell the group where the creatures went after the attack. The tracks and the teeth marks on the bodies seem to come from some sort of predator. The attacking group appears to consist of six individuals. They have killed their prey and begun eating, but then been interrupted and left (either because they heard someone approaching or because they are too stressed out to eat). They might return to finish their meal later. The PCs have three options:</p><ol><li>Continue on their way, which – thankfully – is in the opposite direction from where the nekatra went;</li><li>Try to track the beasts by successfully rolling observation to eliminate the threat of them (in which case they should probably arm themselves at the bridge first); or</li><li>Stage an ambush by the dead bodies and attack the nekatra when they return to finish their meal. If the PCs successfully track or stage an ambush of the nekatra, you could have them face a single creature first (see the scene below) instead of the whole pack (page 39 @UUID[JournalEntry.z413107241785096.JournalEntryPage.f027d1b92da32799]{Hunter and Prey}).</li></ol><p><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 DP</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Desperate Rescue Workers</h3><p>Have the PCs test observation. If they pass, they hear whispering voices in the corridor ahead. Unless they turn around, they soon meet a group consisting of six other survivors led by the aggressive Lahor Iades. The encounter might lead to violence, or at least to high tensions. Unless the PCs have figured out what has killed the majority of the other passengers (radiation) – and that they are likely affected themselves – they probably will now. Have them test manipulation. If they roll well, Lahor’s group will follow their instructions, but failure might lead to hostilities. The other group want to: 1) Find medicine and other useful gear; 2) Find a place sheltered from radiation and nekatra (they have heard the beasts in the distance and lost a comrade); and 3) Find a way off the doomed ship. They know nothing of what has happened to the Ghazali and have encountered no other survivors, but know that the ship is heavily irradiated and that terrible monsters are on the prowl nearby.<br><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 DP</p></div></div></div>"},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":3000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"coriolis-ghazali":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/02 - Act 1 - Emergency","noteRef":""},"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true}}},{"_id":"fb54d0aff39ba5e7","name":"Status Report","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"entryBGVTT\"><div class=\"entryContainer\"><div class=\"entryContent\"><p>When the PCs finally find a working terminal, they encounter the eccentric ship intelligence Suleiman, and finally get some answers. The gravity of their situation becomes apparent, and they realize that the mission has failed – all that remains is to try and make it off the Ghazali alive.</p><h2>The Situation</h2><p>Next to the bulkhead doors separating the different sections of the ship are terminals for interfacing with the ship’s computer, but most are now broken. Senior crew members would have carried tablets for direct contact with Suleiman, but these haven’t survived either. The PCs will have to search for a terminal that still works, and it is up to you as the GM to decide when they find one. Have them sneak around the ship for a while, and sweat a little before they do. The terminal itself is a smooth surface on the wall onto which a PC puts her hand and states her name. The computer comes alive and greets them. Its name is Suleiman and it speaks in a low, thoughtful, male voice. Getting classified information – for example the location of the gun lockers – out of Suleiman isn’t easy, but he is more than willing to assist with evacuating the ship.</p><p>Many of the PCs’ questions will likely remain unanswered, either because Suleiman is too damaged to know the answer (“Unknown”) or because the PCs lack the necessary security clearance (“I am not authorized to share this information”). A powerful EM pulse from the portal detonation has destroyed much of Suleiman’s data banks, and he is not quite himself. Skilled computer operators will know how to work around some of the damage, and might get more out of him. How much information they get from the conversation depends on how well they do on a data djinn test. If they return to speak more with Suleiman later, they don’t have to roll again, but if they are dissatisfied with their level of success, acquiring the captain’s or first officer’s code keys can get them higher security clearance.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>Suleiman Lives</h5><p>If you play the eccentric Suleiman as a living character, the meeting with him will be more dramatic. You could for example equip the terminal with modulation capabilities and have an avatar slowly materialize before the PCs. Suleiman looks like a wise old man, with a ceremonial headdress and shining eyes. The modulation is patchy, with ghostly holes here and there where data is missing. He speaks in a low voice, and looks straight ahead without making eye contact with the PCs. The avatar resembles a spirit from another dimension, which perhaps is what he is.</p></div><h2>Important Facts</h2><p>Have the PCs test data djinn to obtain information from Suleiman.</p><p><strong>Regardless of how they fare, he gives them the following information:</strong></p><ul><li>A map of the Ghazali. See the back of the book.</li><li>The Ghazali’s propulsion systems are offline, and there are no life signs on the bridge. The ship is currently in the Hamura system, one jump from Taoan. The ship is drifting toward the Hamura star, and will reach the D zone (the disintegration zone) in eighteen hours. Large sections of the ship are already destroyed or badly damaged.</li><li>The Ghazali is unmaneuverable, but escape pods can be found in several locations throughout the ship. Some of the ships docked on the port side still appear functional.</li><li>The ship was flooded with radiation when the portal exploded, and much of the sensor and control systems were destroyed. Suleiman has rebooted the remaining systems and is compiling a damage report. This explains why no evacuation order has been given – the jump crew was killed instantaneously, and the automated failsafes were burned out. Large parts of the crew on ice are badly irradiated or deceased.</li><li>The nearest safe port is the Hamurabi portal station, in orbit around Hamura, between the portals. The distance from the Ghazali to the station is currently about 1 AD. Sparsely populated systems like Hamura often have only one portal station, instead of the normal two. A slow ship makes the 1 AD journey in about twenty-four hours, while a fast one could make it there considerably faster.</li><li>The ship’s medlab was spared from damage. Suleiman can light a yellow strip in the floor to guide the way.</li></ul><div class=\"blueheader\">Limited Success</div><ul><li>The escape pods aren’t powerful enough to achieve escape velocity this close to the Hamura star and make it to the Hamurabi station, but ships strong enough to escape the gravitational pull that survived the blast are docked on the port side (one or two, the GM decides). Suleiman can light red strips in the floor guiding the way to the escape pods and the docked ships.</li><li>Information about what actually happened to the liner can be found on the bridge computer’s emerald disk. Suleiman has no contact with any of the systems on the bridge.</li><li>The jump crew was on the bridge at the time of the detonation. It is highly unlikely that any of them are still alive.</li><li>Internal sensors detect forty-seven additional lifeforms onboard, although there might be more, as the data is contradictory and unreliable. About two hundred rescue workers were onboard when the ship left Coriolis.</li><li>The chapel has been cut off from the rest of the ship. The sensors there are badly damaged but indicate that a group of survivors may have gathered there.</li></ul><div class=\"blueheader\">Critical success</div><ul><li>There are about thirty nekatra on the ship, in stasis in groups of between four and six individuals. They belong to the Legion, and are trained for reconnaissance and light skirmishes. They are controlled by their handlers via their collars, but the remote controls are all located on the Zafirah.</li><li>Classified information can be accessed by the captain or the first officer from the bridge. The crew and passengers’ weapons are kept on the bridge. Only the captain and the first officer have the code keys that open the arms locker. This is where the PCs will find their own weapons.</li></ul><h2>The Terminal</h2><p>A screen on the wall with a keyboard, a microphone, and a camera. It comes alive when the PCs approach it. A red light stares at the group from the camera lens. They can use the terminal to contact Suleiman.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act1/stas.webp\"/></div></div></div></div>"},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":4000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"coriolis-ghazali":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/02 - Act 1 - Emergency","noteRef":""},"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true}}}]}

They may also have become aware of other survivors in need of their help. Somewhere on the ship, a pack of nekatra is on the hunt, which could pose a serious threat to poorly armed PCs.

A medically trained PC can offer her comrades professional help here. If Suleiman lit the yellow lightstrips in the floor to guide the PCs to the lab, similar strips were lit all across the ship, and many survivors are now converging on the lab. Apart from the PCs themselves, there are soon a number of survivors to treat (see below). If the PCs manage to settle things peacefully with the nekatra, they too are in need of medical care for radiation poisoning. If the PCs prioritize helping others at the medlab, they are awarded with only the gratefulness of their patients, but it will pay off later in the scenario. Keep the timeframe in mind when the PCs are in the medlab.</p><h2>Important Facts</h2><p>This scene doesn’t provide much in the way of clues as to the fate of the ship, but other survivors might have gotten more out of Suleiman, and can fill in the PCs’ blanks if you’d like.</p><h2>Medlab</h2><p>This section of the ship would have been beautiful back in its day – expensive carpets on the floors and colorful mosaics on the walls – but now, everything is dirty, chipped, and faded. The walls of the medlab are made from a soundproof type of ceramic designed to look like sandstone. The smell of disinfectant is masked by the soothing aroma of cedar wood incense. Statues of the Lady of Tears keep watch over the patient rooms, accompanied by the Judge in the operating room.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/medlabb4.webp\"/></div><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Waiting Room</h3><p>A large open room with patterned carpets and some of its original furniture still intact. A spiral staircase and an (offline) elevator lead from the room to the rest of the ship. The waiting room, with its faded draperies on the walls, becomes a safe place to rest for Ghazali’s weary survivors.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Storage Room/Extra Patient Room</h3><p>A sterile storage room for medical equipment, to restock the patient rooms or the operating room if necessary. There are also three extra beds here, and some basic monitoring equipment, which enables the PCs to turn the room into another patient room with space for six people. A medkit plus ten extra m-doses can also be found here.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Patient Room Blue</h3><p>A patient room equipped to hold seven patients. The walls are modestly decorated with scrolling blue vines on a white background. A medkit plus ten extra m-doses can be found here.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Admission</h3><p>The walls of the room are covered in large screens for patient monitoring. If needed, the room can be converted to fit five additional patients on rugs collected from the waiting room.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Patient Room Purple</h3><p>A room for six patients, similar to the blue room but with purple decorations on the walls. A biomonitor and a medkit, plus ten extra m-doses can be found here.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Operating Room</h3><p>An advanced medlab equipped for most procedures. Two patients can be operated on simultaneously. The room contains four cybernetic prostheses (GM decides what kinds of implants) and one hundred trauma doses. The walls are covered in red velvet draperies with silver, gold, and blue embroidery, and the slabs are made from an expensive type of rock from the Dakhara ridge on Kua – custom ordered to comply with the head surgeon’s wishes.</p><h2>NPCs</h2><p>Below is a list of the NPCs the PCs might encounter during the scene. Khomina and Sabetha Pour are in the medlab when the PCs get there. Brother Ramas and Komoro Vai arrive later.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">KHOMINA, MYSTIC WITH A VISION</div>@Actor[Khomina, Mystic With A Vision]<div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/spakvinnan4.webp\"/></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>Khomina’S Predictions</h5><p>The PCs might want Khomina to read their fortunes. She will do it exchange for a gift or some birr (about 100 birr). Khomina uses her sugar globe when reading their futures, but you can use the Icon deck if you want. Have the player whose destiny is being read draw three cards from the deck. Prepare the deck with the right cards on top, or tailor the story depending on which cards they draw.</p></div><div class=\"blueheader\">BROTHER RAMAS, SAMARITAN FANATIC</div>@Actor[Brother Ramas, Samaritan Fanatic]<div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/Broder Ramas.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"/></div><div class=\"blueheader\">KOMORO VAI, SELFISH LEADER</div>@Actor[Komoro Vai, Selfish Leader]<div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/Lahor Iades03.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"/></div><div class=\"blueheader\">SURVIVORS</div>@Actor[Survivors]<h2>Events</h2><p>The medlab will likely become the focal point for most of the drama in the scenario. Below is a list of events associated with the medlab for the GM to use as you see fit. They can be used in any order, but it is probably a good idea to have both Brother Ramas and Komoro Vai arrive at the lab shortly after the PCs do. The events have no specified time cost, and some of them can be played in parallel. Discuss with your players to determine how time consuming the events you play should be.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Moving Around On The Ghazali</h4><p>Try to make the PCs’ expeditions out from the medlab exciting and dramatic. Describe the empty, dark ship, and prepare encounters along their way – other survivors for sure, but perhaps also nekatra with a taste for human flesh? The plan of the Ghazali on page 6 tells you of the radiation levels of the different sections of the ship. Throw in some events from the Through Darkness scene if you haven’t already used them all.</p></div><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> More Survivors</h3><p>As the medlab becomes the base for the evacuation plans, more and more survivors begin showing up there. They trickle in, alone or in small groups, looking for medicine, supplies, and a way off the ship. The looming threat of certain death has made everyone desperate for guidance, and unless the PCs step up to take charge, others will – Khomina, Brother Ramas, and Komoro Vai for example. They won’t be able to get along, and the risk of arguments and even violence is great. Among the survivors is only one with medical training, Samaritan Brother Ramas. He will gladly help anyone who needs care, except for nekatra, as he regards them as subhuman forms of life. His openness toward others will change when Khomina begins preaching her fatalist message (see below). Free trader captain Komoro Vai will take every chance he can get to undermine the PCs’ efforts to organize the evacuation, and fancies himself a much better leader.<br><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 DP</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Organizing The Evacuation</h3><p>The number of survivors at the medlab increases steadily up until the nekatra scene (page 39 @UUID[JournalEntry.z413107241785096.JournalEntryPage.f027d1b92da32799]{Hunter and Prey}), when it reaches its peak at a hundred and twenty one people, many of whom are in terrible condition. Evacuating all the survivors will be difficult, but not impossible. The hardest part will be selling the desperate and scared rescue workers on the plan – since the escape ship (a class III freighter) can’t fit them all, and many will have to use other means of transportation. The escape ship can fit eighty people if optimally used (or about forty if the PCs accept Sabetha Pour’s offer, see below) which forces the rest to use the remaining escape pods (holding sixteen people) and stasis containers from the cargo hold (twenty people per container). The cargo container part of the plan will cause much distress among the survivors – no one is particularly keen on the idea of going into stasis and being ejected into space with only the PCs’ promises of retrieval standing between them and a lonely and terrible demise.</p><p>The situation for the people in the escape pods isn’t really any better, but they will at least be awake, and it is enough for them not to argue too much about it. Some of the survivors are so badly wounded that they will die before getting off the Ghazali, and many more will likely perish afterwards. The obviously dying aren’t many, but may become targets for all sorts of morally detestable suggestions when it becomes clear that the escape ship is too small. Komoro Vai will have no qualms whatsoever about leaving them behind. If the PCs play their cards right, the other survivors will accept their proposed evacuation plans, but if they fail, the survivors will split into opposing groups, each with a strong, loud leader. At the cost 1 DP, the situation spirals out of hand and the two groups might attack one another for a spot on the escape ship. If the PCs are armed and willing to defend their claim to the escape ship, the fight among the other survivors will be about who gets to go in the escape pods.</p><p>Have the PCs present their plan to the group and test manipulation. If they make a convincing case, they get a +1 to their roll. Komoro Vai will question their suggestions and try to convince the other survivors that he has a better plan. The PCs must win an opposed manipulation test against Komoro. If they failed their initial roll above, they are treated as being outnumbered by Komoro. If they passed the test, they instead outnumber Komoro and his followers. If they achieve a comparative critical success on the roll, they will benefit from this later in the scenario, at the Hamurabi station. Unless the group has armed themselves at the bridge, you can spend 2 DP to have one of the opposing survivor groups have done so, and this group demands access to the escape vessel at gunpoint. If Komoro wins the opposed manipulation test, about half of the remaining rescue workers start to follow him (one of whom is Brother Ramas). Some of them will carry out his orders without question, and may pose a threat to the PCs.<br><strong>Cost</strong>: 0–2 DP</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span>  The Seer</h3><p>Khomina the mystic is a prominent figure among the survivors. It is very possible that the PCs do as many of the others onboard have – ask her for a blessing or a horoscope. The sick and fading gather around her to find solace in her words, but some of the better off also consult her. Khomina boarded the Ghazali after having visited the Judge Emissary on the Xene station. After meeting the Icon, it dawned on her that joining the Ghazali mission would lead her to salvation – something she has sought desperately since her powers began manifesting half a cycle ago. When the disaster hit, Khomina initially despaired like many others, but then remembered the Judge Emissary’s words and understood her purpose. The truth revealed itself to her – salvation is within reach for everyone onboard! All they have to do is stop resisting and accompany the liner into the white-hot flames of the Hamura star. This radical stance infuriates Brother Ramas when word starts spreading that Khomina has met the Emissary purporting to be the Judge. The Samaritans worship only the Judge, under the name the Martyr, and the mere thought that the Martyr would take on physical form to visit a Foundation research station is blasphemy. Moreover, that the Highest One would advocate suicide – passive martyrdom – is heresy bordering on madness, the absolute antithesis of everything Brother Ramas believes in. The conflict between Khomina and Ramas is described in detail below.<br><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 DP</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span>  Come Ye Faithful</h3><p>Two among the survivors have personalities and destinies that will come to affect the PCs whether they like it or not. Their respective beliefs spark intense debate concerning the future and politics of the Horizon, and may force the PCs to choose sides in conflicts they have yet to learn about. Most importantly, the line in the sand concerns the Emissaries – especially the one known as the Judge Emissary, seen as a heretic by the Order of the Pariah. The dispute also revolves around the so-called “new mystics” that have begun turning up all around the Horizon – people wielding actual supernatural powers, but rarely without it costing them their sanity. The conflict between Brother Ramas and Khomina begins as soon as Ramas hears of the seer’s meeting with the Judge Emissary. According to Ramas, such a deranged heathen belongs in the Samaritan Sanatorium on Coriolis. When Khomina adds insult to injury by starting to preach submission and acceptance of the coming destruction of the ship, Ramas can no longer contain his emotions. His calm gives way to a more menacing tone – unless Khomina shuts her mouth, she is a heretic that should be dealt with accordingly.</p><p>Brother Ramas will ask the PCs (or someone else, for example Komor Vai) to lock Khomina up somewhere away from the others so she can’t spread her dangerous delusions. If they refuse to help him, he will refuse to treat their injuries. Eventually, some desperate survivor will attempt to carry out Ramas’ task. Ramas himself will not lay a hand on the seer, or defend himself if attacked – he is first and foremost a pacifist and would rather die than break his oath. The outcome of the conflict between Khomina and Ramas depends on how the PCs act. If they do as Ramas asks and detain Khomina, he will continue to treat their injuries and remain loyal to them for the rest of the scenario (even if they lost the opposed manipulation roll against Komoro Vai). If they refuse to help him, others will take their place, potentially leading to a fight if the PCs decide to protect Khomina. Reuse the Survivors stats above for the fight.</p><p>Khomina will follow the Ghazali into the Hamura star unless she is forcibly removed from the ship. If she is made to evacuate the ship, she becomes catatonic (and a suitable candidate for a stay at the Sanatorium, just as Ramas suggested). If the PCs save the mystic’s life, Brother Ramas will show her mercy and arrange for her to receive treatment back at Coriolis. If no one tries to bring Khomina along, Brother Ramas will try to do it himself. Both Brother Ramas and Khomina’s fates are important, and as the GM, you should try to keep them both alive (although they can be replaced in coming scenarios).<br><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 DP</p></div></div></div>"},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"coriolis-ghazali":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/03 - Act 2 - Survivors","noteRef":"the_medlab"},"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true}}},{"_id":"e8655bd2653c3db6","name":"The Escape Vessel","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"entryBGVTT\"><div class=\"entryContainer\"><div class=\"entryContent\"><p>Several smaller ships are docked on the hull of the Ghazali, but few of them are spaceworthy without major repairs.

If you want to, introduce one other ship (besides the PCs’ own) that can be made spaceworthy in a reasonable amount of time – see the Fatima’s Bounty boxed text. The smaller vessels are all docked amidships, around the “waist” of the liner. Several other survivors will likely head that way to see if any of the ships survived the detonation.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>Fatima&rsquo;s Bounty</h5><p>A new ship is described on page 50 @UUID[JournalEntry.z183801284243520.JournalEntryPage.2bc265fd50ca693e#fatima's-bounty]{Epilogue - Fatima's Bounty}, which can be used as a way off the Ghazali. It is a class III freighter docked on the port side of the liner. Like the PCs’ ship, it is damaged and requires repairs and a reconfiguration before it can be used. The ship’s transponder contains its identification codes and is linked to the Bulletin’s skipper registry. Should the PCs lay claim to the Bounty, their ownership of the ship will sooner or later come into question as it is registered to a Ninia Skados. Tampering with the transponder is illegal.</p></div><h2>Important Facts</h2><p>The PCs can make a quick analysis of the damage to the ships by looking out through a window from the corridor leading to the docks and testing technology. If they fail the test, closer inspections are needed to determine the damage. It will cost them time, and allow other survivors to show up to have a look for themselves. Whether or not any of the others find out which ships are repairable is up to the GM to decide. In order for the PCs to repair their ship, they must pass a technology test. Failure means more time is needed. To reconfigure the ship computer, they must test data djinn. The process takes about three hours, but the computer works on its own and only needs the PCs to initiate the protocols after which they can leave again. Failing the data djinn test adds another three hours to the configuration.</p><h2>The Docks</h2><p>The docks are located amidships on both sides of the ship and the PCs are able to reach their ship through an airlock in one of the two central corridors that run almost all the way from stern to bow. In the space between the corridors is a larger dock housing the Terrim, a now irreparable ship previously used for sub-atmospheric trips. The larger dock can be reached from space through a massive hangar door in the bow of the ship. One can open the doors and activate an ED field to protect the hangar.</p><h2>NPCs</h2><p>Both @Actor[Sabetha Pour, Smuggler] (page 30) and @Actor[Komoro Vai, Selfish Leader] (page 24) will sooner or later seek out the docks to evaluate potential escape vessels.</p><h2>Events</h2><p>Sabetha Pour will attempt to persuade or bribe her way onboard the escape ship (opposed manipulation test). She also has a sensitive proposal she wishes to discuss with the PCs (see below). Komoro Vai will head for the docks with a group of thugs as backup to check out potential escape vessels. He will also challenge the PCs for the role of captain of the escape ship. If you want to, you can introduce one additional spaceworthy ship in this scene, Fatima’s Bounty (see box).</p></div></div></div>"},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":3000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"coriolis-ghazali":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/03 - Act 2 - Survivors","noteRef":"THE_ESCAPE_VESSEL"},"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true}}},{"_id":"88d6e80e810fd827","name":"A Sensitive Proposal","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"entryBGVTT\"><div class=\"entryContainer\"><div class=\"entryContent\"><p>Sabetha Pour is a fixer with a dilemma she hopes the PCs can help her with. There is sensitive cargo in a storage unit onboard that she desperately needs to bring back to Coriolis, no matter the cost. The PCs stand to make a good profit if they take her up on her offer.</p><h2>The Situation</h2><p>Sabetha offers the PCs 25,000 birr (on delivery) if they help her transport the cargo to a secure location. If the PCs open the cargo containers to peek inside, she offers another 15,000 for their silence (which can be raised using manipulation). The cargo comprises twenty (suspiciously coffin-like) boxes marked as containing medical supplies. Sabetha’s shipping manifest looks legit, but it only vaguely specifies the contents of the boxes as ‘therapeutic narcotics’. The boxes are located in a cargo hangar (see the floor plan) on the other side of a locked bulkhead door.</p><h2>Important Facts</h2><p>A successful technology test is required to open the bulkhead door. Without the security tablet provided by Sabetha, the roll is at –2. A failed roll means having to force the door open, costing them 1 EP worth of time (see page 8 @UUID[JournalEntry.z702730060519121.JournalEntryPage.97fdc51f64e4a980#keeping-track-of-time]{Introduction - Keeping Track Of Time}). The most discreet and effective way to load the cargo is to fly a ship down and dock with the hangar from the outside (pilot). A failed roll subjects the ship to a strength 4 attack (weapon damage 1, CRIT 3). Loading the cargo using the hangar’s loader exo requires a dexterity test.</p><p>Alternatively, the cargo can be loaded using a chain of survivors, but this requires passing an insane (–3) manipulation test to make them prioritize this project. Involving more people in dealing with Sabetha’s cargo will eventually lead to word of it getting around, which could lead to trouble when the PCs reach Hamurabi. There are three loader exos in the hangar, enabling three people to load all of the cargo in one hour if they pass their dexterity tests. For a single person, the loading takes three hours. Failed dexterity tests add time to the loading. Sabetha will protest any attempts to open the boxes, as her payment depends on the cargo arriving untampered with. Curious PCs can of course choose to ignore this and open one of the boxes. A successful technology test is required to open the box without damaging the stasis mechanism that keeps the cargo – a human – alive. If you as the GM don’t feel like letting the PCs explore this sidepath right now, you could, for example, require them to have a special codebreaker to open the boxes, one they can only find on Coriolis.</p><h2>The Cargo Hangar</h2><p>Most of the Ghazali’s cargo hangars are located in the aft of the ship. The one containing Sabetha’s cargo can be found deep down on the starboard side. A dirty armaglass window outside the door allows for a peek inside. A panel next to the door can be used when trying to hack the door’s lock, and gives access to the intercom system to communicate with people inside the hangar. The hangar is large and about three storys high to allow for unhindered use of large exos. Ladders connect to a walkway that circles the room. A crane system in the ceiling can be controlled from a panel at the foot of one of the stairs. Large posters with bright yellow safety notices in Zeni stress the use of proper equipment when loading and unloading. Three worn loader exos can be found next to the door. Sabetha’s cargo is stacked in the middle of the room and covered with a black tarp. A large hangar door allows spacecraft to dock directly with the hangar. The panel that controls the hangar door can also seal the inward-facing bulkhead door and depressurize the room. When this function is activated, a loud alarm goes off and warning lights begin to flash.</p><h2>NPCs</h2><p>Sabetha Pour can be found in the medlab, quietly chewing a cigarillo and keeping close watch of the unfolding events from a dark corner.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">Sabetha Pour, Smuggler</div>@Actor[Sabetha Pour, Smuggler]<div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/Sebetha Pour06.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"/></div><h2>Events</h2><p>The events of the scene are described below.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Eavesdropping</h3><p>A fellow survivor (the GM decides who) overhears Sabetha’s conversation with the PCs.

The trapped group have air for a few more hours, but have run out of everything else, and find themselves without any way out of their situation.</p><h2>The Situation</h2><p>A coughing burst of static comes through the intercom. A distorted voice breaks through, at first muffled, but suddenly loud and clear: “This is Koria Yohares, can anybody hear me? We are trapped in the chapel and we can’t get out. We can’t reach the escape pods, we have no exos, we are running out of air. Can anybody hear me?” The voice is calm, tired. Crying and mumbled prayers can be heard in the background. The message fades into static again. If the PCs have stepped up as leaders during the evacuation process, they will be expected to do something to help the trapped group. Large sections of the outer hull around the chapel have been ruptured or torn off, destroying all nearby escape pods and docked ships. The only way to rescue the trapped survivors is to undertake a hazardous spacewalk to reach the chapel airlock.</p><h2>Important Facts</h2><p>The PCs can find out which of the Ghazali’s airlocks are still functional by asking Suleiman (see the ship plan on page 6). The trapped passengers have no exos, but the PCs find four intact suits near the airlock on their side. There are fourteen people trapped in the chapel, meaning that five spacewalks will be required to get everyone out (one person going back with the three empty exos each time to escort the others to safety). The first trip must be performed by a PC, after which other passengers can take over. Each walk back and forth equates to one scene worth of time. The difficult part is the first crossing, reaching the chapel airlock to attach a guide cable. The walk is about a hundred meters across a section of the hull where cracked pieces might come loose. Reaching the chapel airlock requires a successful dexterity test. Failure adds one scene worth of time to the fastening of the cable per failed attempt. During the spacewalk, a number of things can go wrong (see Events below). Should the PCs ignore the message from Koria Yohares and word of this gets out, they suffer a –2 to all further manipulation tests. Komoro Vai is automatically informed of their cowardice and will try to use it to his advantage.</p><h2>Reaching The Chapel Airlock</h2><p>The chapel is located at the top of the ship and a wide panoramic window allows for a view of the void. The extensive damage suffered by the Ghazali has isolated the chapel, making it reachable only by a spacewalk. The nearest airlock can be found in the residential area, putting the distance at about a hundred meters.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Airlock/Exo Storage</h3><p>An airlock at the top of the ship for access to maintenance stations on the hull. The four exo suits found here enable the PCs to spacewalk over to the chapel. A winch with a hundred and fifty meters of cable is located next to the outer airlock door. A spacefarer fastened to the cable can be pulled back to safety should something go wrong during the EVA.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Airlock And Corridor</h3><p>An airlock high up on the liner near the bow. A short corridor leads to the stairs that connect to the chapel.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Staircase</h3><p>A spiral staircase connecting the two floors.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Antechamber</h3><p>A small room reached before entering the chapel. Embroidered tapestries on the walls depict important events from the history of the Ghazali when the Icons interceded on the crew’s behalf. There are benches along the right wall, and a silver washbowl on a marble pillar to the left. A compartment in the pillar contains an empty clay jug.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Chapel</h3><p>A circular chamber containing statues of the eight visible Icons. A polished altar sits in the center of the room. An empty alcove in the wall is located behind the altar, slightly off-center. The trapped survivors huddle together in prayer around the altar. The PCs can pray here for guidance, but it will cost them an hour’s worth of time.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/Ikonernas-kapell03.webp\"/></div><h2>NPCs</h2><p>The trapped survivors in the chapel.

The reconfiguration of their ship’s computer is too slow however, and the air in the chapel will run out if they wait. If the PCs go for this option, Koria manages to send a another message after a while, saying that they are running out of time&hellip;</p></div><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Spacewalk</h3><p>A PC must climb along the hull of the Ghazali to reach the chapel airlock. A number of things might go wrong during the crossing. As the GM, you may spend DP to activate the events below, but you may wish to do so only during the first walk, and save some of the events for when they spacewalk to the bridge later (see below).

Otherwise, they must restrain him or suffer explosive decompression when Merad accidently vents the chapel.<br><strong>Cost</strong>: 2 DP</p></div></div></div>"},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":5000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"coriolis-ghazali":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/03 - Act 2 - Survivors","noteRef":"TO_THE_RESCUE"},"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true}}},{"_id":"2ded61669abd2d13","name":"The Bridge and Weapon Locker","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"entryBGVTT\"><div class=\"entryContainer\"><div class=\"entryContent\"><p>The bridge may become a high priority for the PCs as it is where their weapons are kept, as well as those of the rest of the crew. The captain and the first officer, both now dead, have code keys giving access to the weapons. The keys also give their users higher security clearance when interacting with Suleiman, reducing the difficulty of the data djinn test required to obtain information from the computer. Another reason to visit the bridge could be to retrieve the emerald disc containing the ship’s essential logs that can be found there. The information on the disc could help piece together what actually happened before the PCs woke up. It is common salvage practice to try to retrieve the emerald disc from derelict ships, something which is known to many onboard, as well as by Suleiman.</p><h2>The Situation</h2><p>Blasting through the bulkhead door from the inside is impossible with the tools found onboard. As much of the section around the bridge is badly damaged, the only way inside is across the hull. The ED technology has temporarily restored the atmosphere inside the bridge, while still allowing for passage in and out through the hole in the hull by a person in an exo suit. Inside the ED field, one may act normally and remove one’s exo. The bulkhead door can be opened from the inside, and only one PC has to trek across the hull and enter the bridge from the outside.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/kommandobrygga.webp\"/></div><h2>Important Facts</h2><p>The bridge contains three dead bodies. There should be more, but the others have likely been sucked out into space through the breach in the hull. The bodies are in bad shape – first officer Shanaz Po is strapped into her chair and the corpses of captain Ia Kaschares and colonial agent Nakifa are tangled up in a mess of cables near the breach. The ID cards of the captain and first officer Po can be used as keys for the arms locker. If the PCs can’t find the ID cards, they must hack the lock (technology, –2 without a security tablet). Failure means no guns. Critical success means accomplishing the task faster than expected (see Keeping track of time on page 8 @UUID[JournalEntry.z702730060519121.JournalEntryPage.97fdc51f64e4a980#keeping-track-of-time]{Introduction - Keeping Track Of Time}).</p><p>A communicator on one of the walls repeats a distorted message:</p><p><em>”Warning! Anomaly on entry – unidentified sensor object. Hull breach in section 12. Thrusters are offline. Stasis chamber is offline. Unstable field pattern. Decompression in sections 3, 6, 8, 19. Reactor spike. Activating emergency protocols – firing aft probes…”</em></p><p>The screen goes black for a few seconds, after which the message begins again. The message comes from the Ghazali’s Legion escort, the Zafirah, via a probe that was fired back before the liner made its jump. The ominous warning is repeated over and over, but contains no more data. More data can be found on the Ghazali’s emerald disc, but it must be retrieved and analyzed elsewhere (science).</p><p>Suleiman will point out that the emerald disc should be a priority if the PCs head for the bridge. It is easy to get at, and Suleiman can instruct them on how to remove it safely. It is an oblong disc, twenty centimeters wide and one centimeter thick. It is encrypted using the Colonial Agency’s decryption technology, which is unbreakable to everyone onboard, probably even to Suleiman (who will refuse to try if asked). The secrets of the green disc will remain out of reach for the rest of the scenario. From the bridge, the PCs can contact Suleiman again. If they have acquired either the captain’s or the first officer’s ID cards, their new security clearance gives them a +2 to their data djinn test when interacting with the computer.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Clues For The Mercy Of The Icons Campaign</h4><p>The message from the Zafirah is a clue to the Mercy of the Icons campaign indicating that the ship was attacked, rather than damaged by the jump itself. Read more about the emerald disc on page 3 @UUID[JournalEntry.z702730060519121.JournalEntryPage.97fdc51f64e4a980#overview]{Introduction - Overview}.</p></div><h2>The Bridge</h2><p>The Ghazali’s navigation and central computers can be found on the bridge.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>The Ghazali’S System Communicator</h5><p>The liner’s system communicator can be found on the bridge. It has been damaged but can temporarily be restored by successfully testing TECHNOLOGY. If the PCs use it to transmit an emergency message, they establish contact with the ice hauler Tsepo IV. Both the PCs and captain Madjer of the hauler soon realize that help is too far out, however, and won’t arrive in time&hellip;</p></div><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Stairwell And Bulkhead Door</h3><p>Two spiral staircases lead to a locked bulkhead door. It can only be opened from inside the bridge. The only way inside is for (at least) one PC to spacewalk from the nearby airlock into the bridge and open the door from there.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Bridge</h3><p>A large room housing the liner’s central command node. Handwoven rugs cover the floors and the walls are tastefully decorated with hand painted, religious motifs. A search of the bridge reveals a tag with 780 birr, a transactor with 1,250 birr, and a personal holo communicator.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>Using A Ship To Reach The Bridge</h5><p>The PCs may wish to use their ship to reach the bridge after their computer has been reconfigured. There is a cloud of debris floating outside the bridge, approaching safely requires a successful PILOT test. Failure results in the ship suffering a strength 4 attack (weapon damage 1, CRIT 3). The last stretch requires an exo suit as they will have to jump from their ship in through the breach at the bridge (DEXTERITY).</p></div><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Arms Locker</h3><p>Arms for the crew as well as any weapons taken off passengers are kept in a large, grey metal cabinet on the bridge, with floral engravings on the sides. Pistols and ammunition are on the top shelf, carbines and batons hang below. Suleiman cannot open the locker, but knows that the captain and the first officer would have had key cards. Otherwise, the PCs will have to hack the lock.</p><p><strong>The cabinet contains:</strong></p><ul><li>The PCs’ weapons, if they relinquished any when the boarded the liner</li><li>Two Vulcan pistols with four reloads each</li><li>Eleven shock sticks with two cells each</li><li>Eleven Vulcan carbines with eight reloads each</li></ul></div></div></div>"},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":6000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"coriolis-ghazali":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/03 - Act 2 - Survivors","noteRef":"THE_BRIDGE_AND_WEAPON_LOCKER"},"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true}}},{"_id":"f027d1b92da32799","name":"Hunter and Prey","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"entryBGVTT\"><div class=\"entryContainer\"><div class=\"entryContent\"><p>Regardless of whether the PCs track the nekatra down, wait for them to come back to the mangled corpses they’ve found, or try to stay away, they will sooner or later have to encounter them anyhow.</p><h2>The Situation</h2><p>Depending on where the encounter takes place, the location might be more or less suitable for a firefight (science). Vulcan fire near weak spots in the outer hull may cause explosive decompression. The nekatra have been trained by the Legion to use this to their advantage and will try to find places where the enemy must limit their use of firearms. If the PCs manage to track the nekatra, they will likely find them near the outer hull, and the same goes for if they encounter them by chance. Only if the PCs actively remain in the inner regions of the ship will the hungry and desperate nekatra seek them out there.</p><p>As the GM, use the nekatra threat to put the players on edge, but they should have a fighting chance to defeat the beasts in combat. Depending on the combat prowess (especially in terms of close combat) and weaponry of your group (smuggled onboard, improvised, or taken from the bridge), you should tailor the nekatra encounter to make it dramatic, but not necessarily lethal – not for the whole group at least. Alternatively, the nekatra might try to negotiate with the PCs, or vice versa, but should this fail, they will begin attacking lone survivors until it becomes obvious that the PCs must see to the situation with force.</p><h2>Important Facts</h2><p>Depending on where the fight takes place, heavy weapons fire may lead to unintentional and unwanted consequences. By successfully testing science, the PCs can find a ‘safe’ place away from weak spots in the hull where they may use as much of their arsenal as they please. Another way to deal with the situation is to get into exos and then seek out the nekatra, possibly intentionally breaching the hull. There is a small chance that the encounter can be resolved without violence, however. The creatures are scared and, even under normal circumstances, less prone to calculated foresight than humans, but they want a way off the ship and know that this is beyond what they can accomplish on their own. The PCs can try to negotiate with the nekatra, but it will be difficult. To have a shot at all, they must either pass a culture test or have access to a @Item[Language Unit] (page 108 of the Coriolis core rulebook). They must then promise the nekatra a way off the ship and pass a manipulation test at –2 (without bonus dice from Reputation). If the test fails, the nekatra feel threatened and attack. If they pass, the nekatra stay out of their way but near the escape vessel until it is time to get out. If the PCs try to trick the nekatra and are found out, their retaliation will be merciless.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/Mote med Nekatra6.webp\"/></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Risking Explosive Decompression</h4><p>All shots fired near the outer hull that miss their targets risk breaching the integrity of the hull, leading to explosive decompression. Intentionally firing at a weak spot to vent a section of the ship is very easy (RANGED COMBAT +3). The hull has 3 HP and an armor rating of 6. The liner has two security systems in place to limit the effects of hull breaches – the breached section is immediately sealed off by rapidly closing bulkhead doors (in the same turn as the breach), and an ED field plugs the hole (two turns later). As Suleiman has a lot on his mind and isn’t quite his normal self, it may take longer for the security systems to activate in some cases. See page 99 of the Coriolis core rulebook @UUID[JournalEntry.z151543463005475.JournalEntryPage.954b55bb8afaf0fe#vacuum]{Vacuum} for more information about explosive decompression.</p></div><h2>NPCs</h2><p>Below are descriptions of the nekatra and their abilities.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">ZHASAI, ALPHA FEMALE</div>@Actor[Zhasai, Alpha Female]<div class=\"blueheader\">NEKATRA</div>@Actor[Nekatra (Ghazali)]<div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/act2/nekatra_strid_varelse.webp\"/></div><h2>Events</h2><p>Below is a list of nekatra related events, to be used whenever you feel like it during Act II. The last two events take place after Act II. Use the nekatra to make the PCs feel like there are no safe places onboard the Ghazali.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Lurking Fear</h3><p>The PCs hear a screeching noise, like claws across a metal panel. The sound echoes and reverberates, making it hard to determine where it came from, but it is drawing nearer. The nekatra have caught the PCs’ scent and are on their trail. They communicate using wailing, hissing sounds. They stay out of sight until they see a good opportunity to strike. Have the PCs test observation to spot a shadow in the corner of their eye or smell a strange odor. Give them a good scare!<br><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 DP</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Deathstrike</h3><p>As the PCs are interacting with a group of other survivors (at the docks or while loading Sabetha Pour’s cargo for example), they hear a scream coming from nearby. The scream is suddenly cut off, and someone notices that a (minor, unimportant) NPC is missing. They find bloody tracks nearby and may test survival to track the nekatra back to their pack.<br><strong>Cost</strong>: 0 DP</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Show Of Force</h3><p>A young male attacks the PCs to show off. It chooses a strategically advantageous time and place, when the PCs are divided or off guard. He lunges at them from the shadows, attacking the largest individual in the group. If the beast is seriously injured, it retreats. A survival test allows the PCs to track it back to the pack.<br><strong>Cost</strong>: 1 DP</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Assaulting The Medlab</h3><p>The entire nekatra pack attacks the PCs at the medlab (or wherever they have set up camp). They are desperate and try to kill as many survivors as possible, but will spare a single one whom they plan to threaten to help them escape the ship. If they encounter a unified opposition, they retreat and bide their time until the evacuation. Keep in mind that nekatra are very formidable opponents and limit their numbers to match the PCs’ combat skills.<br><strong>Cost</strong>: 2 DP</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> A Final Attempt</h3><p>The remaining nekatra attack the PCs’ ship and try to make in onboard. They will spare a single person to pilot the ship out.<br><strong>Cost</strong>: 2 DP</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Stowaway</h3><p>A nekatra has managed to sneak onboard the PCs’ ship and is hiding in the cargo hold. Sooner or later, someone on the ship detects the unwanted guest, but it may not happen until they reach Hamurabi and the ship is searched by port inspector Asal Harub.<br><strong>Cost</strong>: 1 DP</p></div></div></div>"},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":7000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"coriolis-ghazali":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/03 - Act 2 - Survivors","noteRef":""},"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true}}},{"_id":"a8d7bd286027ff34","name":"Panic!","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"entryBGVTT\"><div class=\"entryContainer\"><div class=\"entryContent\"><p>The intercoms cough, wail, quiet, and then crackle back to life with Suleiman’s calm voice:</p><p><em>“Four minutes ago, the reactor experienced a coolant malfunction and repeated attempts to shut off the reaction inside the core have failed. The time until a catastrophic reactor failure is estimated at T minus 57 minutes. I repeat: catastrophic reactor failure in T minus 57 minutes.”</em></p><h2>The Situation</h2><p>When about ten hours remain of the PCs’ initial timeframe, the situation changes again – the reactor is about to collapse, and Suleiman can only guarantee its stability for about another hour. This scene is designed to make sure the PCs wrap up their unfinished business and get out as fast as possible! As the GM, you are of course free to alter the new timeframe – both in terms of Suleiman’s estimate and at which point the reactor actually fails. To add even more suspense, you could suggest to the players than Suleiman is in bad shape and may have given them an unreliable estimate. Feel free to flavor the evacuation with panicking NPCs, nekatra attacks, and malfunctioning docking clamps or airlocks. The more high-strung the PCs are when they finally reach their ship, the more dramatic the discovery of the hidden defect in their ship’s computer (see below). Remove EP tokens from the map of the Ghazali until 6 tokens remain. Proceed to remove a token every ten minutes, or whenever it fits with the tempo of the story.</p></div></div></div>"},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":8000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"coriolis-ghazali":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/03 - Act 2 - Survivors","noteRef":""},"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true}}}]}

From the outside, it looks like any other portal station, a lonely chunk of dark metal and flashing lights, covered in docked ships of various shapes and sizes. Inside, the rundown corridors and dim-lit halls are rife with intrigue, adventures and danger. Onboard the station, a power-hungry colonial agent, a paragon of the people, and an infiltrator are fast approaching a crisis and showdown. Welcome to Hamurabi, an outpost of civilization in the vast nothingness of space. </span><br/><br/><p><strong>Hamurabi</strong> is the only station in the Hamura system, and thus a natural stop for jumpers from Kua headed for the Dabaran circle. Hamurabi is located between the two portal fields and is visited by ships going in both directions, a common solution in systems with little traffic. Portal station Hamurabi is an open sector and an archetypal portal station in the Third Horizon.</p><p>The station orbits the Hamura star and the two portal fields are approximately 1 AU from the station in opposite directions. The closest planet to the station is the mining moon Abui, orbiting the gas giant Nestero. Abui passes Hamurabi at a distance of 3 AUs every three segments.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/epilogue/Hamurabistationen03_fri.webp\"/></div><h2>Overview</h2><p>Like most portal stations of this model, Hamurabi&rsquo;s aesthetics are simple and practical, except in the core of the station, where rose windows filter multi-colored light across dark carpets, and the smell of food from the cantina creates a homely atmosphere. Rooms and residential modules are often decorated with colorful textiles and religious items such as small altars, candles, prayer towers with burning incense and exquisitely engraved reliquaries. The chapel onboard is also an oasis of peace and beauty in a world otherwise dominated by steel, glass and rubber. Outside of the core, halls and corridors are often poorly lit, and whole sections sometimes go dark altogether (a problem blamed on parasitic organisms from Abui).</p><p>The Hamurabi station is treated as an ordinary environment in regards to tech availability and prices (see Chapter 6 of the Coriolis core rulebook).</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Facts About Hamurabi</h4><ul><li><strong>Population</strong>: 131 permanent residents, plus between fifty and one hundred hands working the ice mines, and some free traders, prospectors and colonists. No semi-intelligences or slummers.</li><li><strong>Physical data</strong>:  Roughly 600 meters wide and 280 meters long.</li><li><strong>Law and order</strong>:  A company of twenty hired guards (see the table in the Characters and Creatures section for their game stats) keeps the peace under the leadership of Commander Alsha Bashir, who in turn answers to Station chief Rhavinn Bokor of the Foundation. Bashir and Bokor handle petty crime and punishment, but more serious criminal activity is delegated to the courts on Coriolis.</li><li><strong>Governance</strong>: The station is run by the Consortium, mainly through the Foundation&rsquo;s station chief, responsible for the portal field analyses sold to passing ships. The Colonial Agency is also present onboard to maintain contact with the scattered colonies in the system, as is the Bulletin, running mail service and the news probes</li></ul></div><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Docks And Landing Platforms</h3><p>The station has twelve docks and two platforms for smaller craft (classes I through III) as well as four docks for larger vessels (class IV). Hamurabi is a standard space station, and service costs here are normal (±0 modifier). The docking fee is included in the service cost (see p 155 of the Rulebook).</p><p>Overzealous port bureaucrat Asal Harub keeps his unclean offices next to the landing platforms. He is very serious about his job, and will not hesitate to demand access to ship logs or even to be allowed onboard to search the PCs&rsquo; ship if he thinks something looks suspicious.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>Weapons On The Station</h5><p>Anyone can carry weapons on the station, but if the PCs should choose to walk around with visible guns and armor they are sure to attract attention, and eventually the gaze of Commander Bashir. He has no problem with a holstered Vulcan pistol, but would rather see heavier weapons and armor kept onboard the PCs&rsquo; ship. Defying the commander on this issue will result in immediate expulsion from the station.</p></div><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span>  The Souk</h3><p>The circular plaza at the top of the station is its heart. It has a diameter of about seventy meters and is filled with all sorts of businesses, from junk shops and food stalls to workshops and tech stores. The available merchandise is somewhat limited, but most ordinary tech can be found here. Brahani&rsquo;s and several other cantinas surround the souk, most of them just holes in the wall. The Icon chapel and the offices of the Bulletin can also be found here, and a short corridor connects the plaza to the medlab. In a corner of the souk, Khabaran Nazim is running a small contract agency for freelancers (see p 215 of the Rulebook).</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/hamurabi/Centrumsal.webp\"/></div><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Medlab</h3><p>The portal station is equipped with a medlab, ruled firmly by Chief Medicurg Lumara Akbion. She is mainly interested in the most serious cases, and lets her two assistants tend to the other patients.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Brahani&rsquo;s</h3><p>The largest cantina onboard the station. The clientele is anything but picky and holds the food and drink of Brahani&rsquo;s to be of excellent quality. When station management or other important guests visit the cantina, Nia Brahani and her three employees bring out the special reserve to serve delicate food and beverages, although the limited supply of raw materials sometimes makes the combinations a bit interesting. The prices of these specialty dishes are steep, deterring common folk from ordering them, which helps to maintain their exclusivity. Nia is always interested in new faces, and knows just about everything about the station and its inhabitants. She can tell the PCs how to approach the station akbar, the colonial agent, the Bulletin journalist and the preacher.</p><p>Brahani&rsquo;s is open during the morning, day and evening watches, but closes during the night. There are always at least a few guests here: in the morning it is mostly stevedores sharing a hookah, some kawah or a samovar of chai before a long day of work begins; small groups of administrative employees usually arrive during the day, and in the evening it is not uncommon for station management or other prominent faces to show up, such as Medicurg Akbion or Talib the preacher. The final hours before closing belong to the younger members of the station&rsquo;s administration, centered on colonial agent Yasitra Hur and the Bulletin&rsquo;s Anata Garam. The occasional prospector or visiting colonist might show up at any time of the day, but they usually don’t fit in too well because clothing, behavior and level of intoxication.</p><p>The cantina&rsquo;s main attraction is Emira the dancer and her white, bionic snake, spellbinding her audience one night a week. Mean rumors say that the fiery Emira is having a secret affair with Yasitra Hur, the pompous colonial agent.</p><p>When the hands of the Abui ice mines are on leave, Brahani&rsquo;s is transformed from a tasteful watering hole to a rowdy and violent place, disturbing the otherwise calm life of the station.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Sleeping Ekilibri&rsquo;s Coffin Hostel</h3><p>A somewhat decent coffin hostel for visitors who desire peace and quiet after a stressful voyage. Simple but cheap.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Akbar&rsquo;s Residence</h3><p>Station chief Rhavinn Bokor&rsquo;s residence bears a strong resemblance to the Museum of History on Coriolis, and is located in a cylindrical tower almost reaching to the ceiling of the souk. The walls of Mister Bokor&rsquo;s relatively spacious home are covered in relics and trinkets from all corners of the Horizon. Most visitors granted a little of the Akbar’s time only get to see the audience chamber, which is a large, circular room with a low table in the middle. Prominent guests are entertained at the table, but visitors of less importance are shown to small sitting cushions along the walls. Two wide panoramic windows show the darkness of space on one side and the commotion of the souk on the other. Mister Bokor&rsquo;s scribe and assistant, Naaji, is present during all audiences.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Offices Of The Bulletin</h3><p>Bulletin correspondent Anata Garam&rsquo;s combined post office and newsroom. Deliveries bound for the fringes of the system come through here, and captains stopping at the station often check the info terminals at the docks to see if there are any mail runs for their destinations available. Courier work is often easy money in Hamura. Anata Garam and colonial agent Yasintra Hur handle deliveries for the outer colonies collaboratively. The two young careerists can often be found together at Brahani&rsquo;s in their spare time. Anata&rsquo;s offices are worth a visit for crews looking for courier work. Hauling goods or information from here to Kua or elsewhere provides decent pay.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span>  The Chapel Of The Icons</h3><p>Preacher Talib Ogor runs the station&rsquo;s simple but beautiful chapel. Together with two apprentices – stevedore Nala and administrator Bilal – Ogor runs the chapel and tends to most of the station&rsquo;s spiritual needs. Most residents visit at least once per segment. The outgoing preacher is always present at social events around the station, and can often be found at Brahani&rsquo;s, where he takes his dinner with Rhavinn Bokor.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Offices Of The Colonial Agency</h3><p>Colonial agent Yasintra Hur&rsquo;s offices are located just off Landing Platform Two. From here, she and her two staff members register new claims and colonies. Together with Anata Garam of the Bulletin, Yasintra makes sure that the colonists of the system get their mail and deliveries.  Hur and Garam can often be seen together as they have much in common – they are both young women with big dreams for the future who have accepted the posting to Hamurabi as a necessary step to ensure professional advancement.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/hamurabi/hamurabi_layout.webp\"/></div><h2>The Situation</h2><p>Hamurabi is your average Third Horizon portal station. It is mainly a place where bored crews can wait for bulk haulers with which to jump to Kua, but it is also home to a small group of permanent residents, either operating the station or working on small-scale research projects. To the colonists and prospectors in Hamura, the station is their oasis, both socially and practically – it is where they restock their supplies, catch up on the happenings of the Horizon and purchase spare parts and new machinery. The mail and courier services of the system are based on Hamurabi.</p><p>Under the sleepy exterior of daily life on the station, tensions are running high. The power games of the factions influence the entire Horizon, causing bad blood between the stationaries and the hands on Hamurabi. A few of these conflicts are described below.</p><p>After the Taoan incident (see page 184 of the Coriolis core rulebook @UUID[JournalEntry.z282908631798242.JournalEntryPage.2ff5a7c6eb123ec9#the-taoan-distress-call]{The Taoan Distress Call}), Hamurabi has rapidly become more and more isolated. Only a handful of prospectors and ice haulers bound for Abui pass the station these days.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Abui Ice Mines</h3><p>The closest world to Hamurabi is Abui, a moon orbiting the gas giant Nestero. The moon is home to a community of hired hands mining ice for the Colonial Agency. The ice from Abui is very valuable if delivered to the right buyer, and the Consortium have signed lucrative ice trading contracts with the pasha of Dar Bouti on Dabaran, among others. Abui passes relatively close to Hamurabi once every three segments, and the miners usually take this opportunity to visit the station, a veritable paradise in comparison to the dark mines. These visits are the cause of much conflict onboard. The permanent residents of Hamurabi are tired of the loud, well-paid miners wreaking havoc at Brahani&rsquo;s and their other bars. The Free League&rsquo;s representative on the station, Didier Abédi, is working tirelessly to improve the miners&rsquo; abysmal labor conditions, but this struggle is not buying him any favors with the locals – the miners are well compensated for their dangerous work, and the stationaries are envious of their spending when on leave on the station. The Consortium&rsquo;s people on the station have orders to make sure that the mines operate smoothly, and spend considerable resources to make sure that they do.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Abui, The Mining Moon</h4><p>On Abui, the Colonial Agency is mining ice for lucrative export to other worlds. The mine itself is an intricate system of tunnels running deep beneath the moon’s surface. The PCs might visit Abui because of some involvement in the intrigues on Hamurabi. On the surface of the moon there is a small loading dock, a control room and living quarters for the mining crew. The core of the moon is reached by fast mine cars on rails running through the tunnels. The ice is mined using massive crawlers equipped with mercurium drills. Sometimes, whole groups of miners disappear in the tunnels, and these incidents seem to be increasing in frequency. Is there something more than ice hiding in the dark heart of Abui?</p></div><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Samina&rsquo;s Corsairs</h3><p>Corsair captain Samina is infamous across the Third Horizon. With absolute precision and bold audacity, she attacks couriers and spare parts transports all over Hamura. Lately, her corsairs have also been targeting the popular cruise liners bound for the water planet Hamura.</p><p>The increasing boldness of the corsairs&rsquo; raids could be the beginning of their downfall, however – powerful factionaries on Coriolis have begun questioning why nothing drastic is done about the corsair problem in the Hamura system. Station Akbar Bokor and colonial agent Hur are under increasing pressure to produce results in their fight against Samina.</p><h2>Characters And Creatures</h2><p>Hamurabi&rsquo;s most important residents and generic NPCs such as hands and station guards are described in the table below.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">Rhavinn Bokor, Station Akbar</div>@Actor[Rhavinn Bokor, Station Akbar]<div class=\"blueheader\">Yasintra Hur, colonial agent</div>@Actor[Yasintra Hur, Colonial Agent]<div class=\"blueheader\">Emira (Samina), Dancer and Corsair Captain</div>@Actor[Emira (Samina), Dancer and Corsair Captain]<div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/hamurabi/Dansös.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"/></div><div class=\"blueheader\">Didier Abédi, representative of the Free League</div>@Actor[Didier Abédi, Representative of the Free League]<div class=\"sizedCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/hamurabi/Fackrepresentant.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"/></div><div class=\"blueheader\">Lupino Mbia, colonial overseer</div>@Actor[Lupino Mbia, Colonial Overseer]<h2>Events</h2><p>The Hamurabi station is an excellent place for the GM to introduce new characters, plots and side stories. Crews travelling the Horizon generally spend quite a lot of time on portal stations waiting for jump coordinates or a bulk hauler to jump with.</p><p>Onboard the station, the PCs can rest, purchase new gear and look for new contracts or missions. It is not unusual for these micro-societies to teem with intrigue and conflicts for the PCs to get dragged into. A few examples are described below.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Welcoming Committee</h3><p>When the PCs dock at Hamurabi, Asal Harub the bureaucrat approaches them accompanied by two guards. They demand to be let onboard for an inspection, as they have received an anonymous tip about the PCs being smugglers. Do they have anything to hide? Maybe one of the group&rsquo;s enemies has bribed a station guard to plant incriminating evidence onboard?</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span>  The Bulletin</h3><p>Bulletin correspondent Anata Garam receives a tip about the PCs and takes an interest in them. She follows them around, digs around in their backgrounds for a scoop and even goes so far as to break into their ship to look for information. This is a perfect opportunity for the GM to hold the PCs accountable for poor judgment or morally questionable choices in previous adventures. Anata will not back down easily, but threats, blackmail or violence could force her to lay off.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Free League</h3><p>The Colonial Agency and the mining overseer have had enough of Didier Abédi&rsquo;s interference in their business, and decide that the time has come for the League agent to suffer a little accident. Abédi becomes stuck in an airlock that suffers decompression, but manages to get into an exo and make it out alive. He suspects that the whole affair was arranged by someone, and hires the PCs to act as bodyguards and detectives. Overseer Lupino will not give up without a fight, and will think up a series of spectacular and creative ways to get rid of the agent. Meanwhile, Abédi asks the PCs to investigate the overseer and the colonial agent and to look for evidence of illegal activities. Perhaps this mission will lead the PCs to new adventures on Abui?</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Corsair Problem</h3><p>Colonial agent Yasintra Hur has grown tired of her transports being raided by corsairs. She suspects that the corsairs receive information about transport routes from someone on the station – how else can they strike with such precision? Hur hires the PCs to poke around the station and try to find out who is leaking information to the corsairs. Among the suspects are Asal Harub, the bureaucrat, Commander Alsha Bashir and colonial overseer Lupino Mbia. Ironically enough, it is Yasintra herself who is the leak! Every now and then, she spends the night with Emira the dancer, who is actually corsair extraordinaire Samina in disguise, and has been working Hur for information for months!</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>Mini Adventure</h5><p>The event &ldquo;The corsair problem&rdquo;  is an excellent opportunity for a GM who wishes to send the PCs on a mini adventure. It will start with the PCs gathering evidence on Hamurabi to expose Samina and Yasintra. Samina might manage to escape, and if she does, Akbar Bokor will send the PCs after her, all the way to a secret smuggler hideout on the Gupka station orbiting the mysterious planet Yublai&hellip;</p></div><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/hamurabi/Station01.webp\"/></div></div></div></div>"},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"coriolis-ghazali":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/07 - Hamurabi","noteRef":""},"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true}}}]}

The ship hangs like a dead parasite on its host body, content with its imminent disintegration. Suleiman’s calm voice breaks the silence to inform them that they have seven minutes to reach the minimum safe distance from the Ghazali.</p><h2>The Situation</h2><p>If the PCs turn to Suleiman for help, he informs them that there appears to be a flaw in the ignition sequence softw they can escape, temporary repairs to the main ignition computer must be made. It can be done from the bridge and requires a successful data djinn test at +1. The prayer re-roll will probably come in handy here. If they pass the roll, they have saved themselves and a ship full of desperate rescue workers. As soon as the ignition sequence has been restored, they speed away from the Ghazali with just enough time to spare to make it to a safe distance. The liner vanishes in a flash of light behind them. Trembling and tasting blood, they are finally safe, with nothing more to do than to sit down, have a cup of steaming rose water, and wait for the Hamurabi portal station to show up on their sensors.</p><h2>Important Facts</h2><p>It could be an interesting twist to let sabotage be the reason behind the faulty ignition sequence. If this is the case, it should be easily recognizable to the PCs. An NPC (Sabetha Pour, Komoro Vai, or perhaps even Koria Yohares) might secretly have managed to repair another ship and wants to make sure the PCs perish with the Ghazali. The PCs spot another ship departing from a dock nearby and disappearing into space. After repairing the ignition sequence, the PCs may want to pursue the saboteurs, which could lead to a grand finale for the scenario involving space combat!</p><h2>NPCs</h2><p>The hidden malfunction is a story tool you can use to really put pressure on the players. Should all of the PCs fail the data djinn test, however, have an NPC (Sabetha Pour, Koria Yohares, Komoro Vai, or someone else) repair the ignition sequence for them. It wouldn’t feel right if the PCs all died because of one failed roll after making it this far. A failed roll should have consequences, however. The other passengers might for example give credit for the entire evacuation to the NPC who repaired the ignition, or they might turn on one of the PCs, giving her the blame for almost getting everybody killed.</p><h2>Events</h2><p>If you haven’t gotten your players sweating enough already, some final events can be thrown in to increase tension even further. Perhaps some nekatra make it onboard the ship and attack the PCs, or an NPC might panic at the sight of the PCs’ clumsy attempts at repairing the ignition sequence, demanding to take over. Hostile NPCs may try to use the desperate situation to stage a mutiny and remove the PCs as heads of the evacuation!</p></div></div></div>"},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":2000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"coriolis-ghazali":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/04 - Act 3 - Evacuating the Ghazali","noteRef":""},"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true}}},{"_id":"f305c882b82fddfb","name":"Gathering the Flock","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"entryBGVTT\"><div class=\"entryContainer\"><div class=\"entryContent\"><p>The evacuees that didn’t fit onboard the PCs’ ship are now floating around in space in escape pods and cargo containers.

It might seem like an odd twist at the end of this scenario, but it ties in with the coming scenarios in the Mercy of the Icons campaign. If you don’t plan on playing the campaign or if you want a more immediate explanation, the vision may instead concern an additional ship of survivors from the Ghazali drifting in space, whom the PCs, thanks to the vision, are able to locate and rescue.</p><p><em>The stars above you fade into darkness, a suffocating, silent black threatening all life, all hope. The flickering light that remains only serves to emphasize the vastness of the void. The rock below you is cold, scarred by thousands of quiet collisions in deep space, itself a remnant from a larger collision aeons ago, lightyears away. Stardust covers your body. Your breath, which the endless hunger of space should be ripping from your chest, hangs in clouds in front of you, crystallizing on the cold surface of the rock. The stone rotates slowly, held captive in orbit around an alien planet. The planet enters your view, greenish blue under heavy grey clouds. Your rock keeps rotating and the planet disappears, darkness enveloping you once again. When the world below returns, you see raging, eternal storms plaguing the surface, and a single, black monolith protruding through the clouds, reaching for the stars. Lightning seems to be emanating from – or converging on – this lonesome sentinel.</em></p><p><em>Suddenly, the storms subside, only to explode in a single, violent discharge seconds later, releasing a lightning bolt headed directly at your rock. The stone shatters into dust, falling out of orbit, and disintegrating as it enters the atmosphere. You hold on to one of the larger fragments, clawing the frozen rock until your fingers bleed frozen, black bubbles of blood onto the stone. You have arrived at your journey’s end, to face the Icons’ judgement. But you find that you aren’t alone. A small child floats next to you in the burning cloud, boy or girl is hard to tell. It fixes a serious gaze on you, and speaks, but you can’t make out the words. You cry out that you can’t hear anything, but the child only smiles. Its voice suddenly reverberates through your head without it moving its lips: ”Everything will be all right”. The clouds below you part and the planet’s greens and blues stun you with their beauty. The stars have returned from the darkness above you, bright dots of hope in the night. You suddenly know that the child is right and let go of your rock. Instead of falling, you softly enter a low orbit around the planet.

The scenario is a standalone prologue to the Mercy of the Icons campaign, and will introduce characters that return later on, but playing through it before starting the campaign is not required. The scenario is linked to several important events in the history of the Third Horizon (page 180 of the Coriolis core rulebook @UUID[JournalEntry.z282908631798242.JournalEntryPage.7f5d442dfcb1028c]{The History of the Horizon}), and the PCs may become a vital part of the cluster’s future if they play their cards right. The three acts below describe a chain of events starting with the catastrophic engine failure of the Ghazali, plus a description of the Hamura system and the Hamurabi portal station, the place they will most likely head for after making it off the doomed liner.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/introduction/GHAZALI4.webp\"/></div><h2>Background</h2><p>A desperate and fragmentary distress call reaches Coriolis, coming from a colony on the gas giant Taoan. The Tsurabi gas mine, partly submerged in the planet’s thick atmosphere, is in desperate need of assistance, but for unknown reasons. The Colonial Agency is the primary owner of the colony and quickly scrambles a rescue fleet to try and evacuate the colonists and salvage the precious mining equipment. The fleet is focused on a decommissioned luxury liner called the Ghazali, which is rapidly upgraded to hold five hundred stasis units – enough for both the two hundred rescue workers and the staff of the Tsurabi, should they need extraction. Many smaller ships accompany the Ghazali, as the Agency has promised handsome rewards to all skippers who sign up for the mission. The smaller vessels dock with the mothership and their crews are put on ice aboard the Ghazali. The Legion supplies an escort in the form of a destroyer, the Zafirah. The rescue mission’s first jump is successful, but the second ends in disaster.</p><p>The Zafirah enters the portal field to Taoan, but something happens shortly thereafter. Enormous amounts of energy are released from the portal and the Ghazali is bathed in hard radiation, which immediately kills the jump crew performing the final checks before going back on ice for the jump. The liner’s engines are destroyed and the ship computer is damaged. The blast from the portal knocks the ship off course and it begins to accelerate toward the strongest gravitational pull in the system – the Hamura star. Most of the smaller vessels docked on the hull of the ship are blown away by the detonation, and the majority of the ships waiting to jump after the Ghazali are also destroyed. The options for escaping the dying titan are suddenly very limited. Shortly after the detonation, the backup systems for the central computer kick in, and all remaining crew are brought out of stasis. The scenario begins as the PCs wake from their dreamless hyper sleep and realize that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Timeline</h3><p>If you want to use The Last Voyage of the Ghazali as a prologue to the Mercy of the Icons campaign, you might find the following timeline useful. You are of course free to alter it however you like.</p><ul><li><strong>The Ghosts from Xene</strong>: In CC 60, in the segment of the Traveler, the Emissaries arrive in the Kua system.</li><li><strong>The Judge</strong>: During the Cyclade celebrations, the Bulletin transmits a special broadcast from the Foundation’s research station at Xene, where one of the five mysterious Emissaries has declared itself the Judge incarnate.</li><li><strong>The Messenger</strong>: The following day – the first day of the new year – another Emissary arrives at Coriolis in a Foundation cruiser escorted by two Legion battleships. The Governor of Coriolis makes a statement welcoming the Emissary to the Council of Factions, and it soon becomes known as the Messenger Emissary.</li><li><strong>The Mystics&rsquo; Disease</strong>: Soon after the arrival of the Emissaries, individuals all across the Third Horizon begin manifesting supernatural powers leading to persecution and religious hatred. Many of these so-called “new mystics” travel to Coriolis for protection, and to be closer to the Messenger Emissary, or to the Foundation’s Xene station to meet the Judge Emissary.</li><li><strong>The Taoan Incident</strong>: After a mining colony transmits a distress call to Coriolis in the segment of the Gambler in CC 61, a rescue fleet focused on the Ghazali passenger liner and the Legion’s Zafirah destroyer departs the station for the Taoan system. The first suite of scenarios in the Mercy campaign begins in the fall of CC 61, for example, around the Cyclade celebrations and the segment of the Faceless One.</li></ul><h2>Overview</h2><p>When the scenario begins, the PCs wake up onboard the Ghazali liner as it is slowly but steadily falling into the nearby Hamura star. The theme of the scenario is survival, and the PCs’ goal is to find a way off the doomed ship. First, they must figure out what is going on (Act I) and what they need to do before they can escape (Act II). The turning point comes when the ship’s computer suddenly informs the PCs that the Ghazali’s reactor is about to suffer a meltdown, and their timetable becomes dangerously short. Act III deals with the tumultuous escape from the Ghazali and the subsequent search for other passengers that have made it off the cruiser in escape pods. Over the course of the scenario, the PCs must deal with panicking passengers, high levels of radiation, and escaped, bloodthirsty nekatra, as the consuming flames of the Hamura star draw ever closer outside the windows.</p><p>Surrounded by danger, the PCs must find a way to reach surviving rescue workers that have been trapped in other parts of the ship, organize the evacuation, and salvage the emerald disc from the main computer that contains the answers to what actually happened before the jump to Taoan. The likely destination for the escapees is the Hamurabi portal station, and this is where the aftermath of the scenario takes place. Ideally, the PCs can drop off the rest of the survivors there, share their story with the Bulletin, sell the emerald disc, and reap the rewards of their heroic handling of the situation. The scenario ends when the PCs prepare for the jump back to Kua. They have likely established themselves as trustworthy and resourceful – traits highly sought-after in the Horizon – and things appear to be looking up for them. However, powerful events have been set in motion behind the scenes, and the Third Horizon’s darkest hour is fast approaching – the trials and tribulations of your PCs have only just begun.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Ghazali</h3><p>The Ghazali cruise liner was once a beautiful ship, tastefully furnished with mosaic walls and floors, draperies on the walls, and colorful embroidery on the furniture. Despite its huge size, it was only designed to carry three hundred passengers – the wealthiest of the wealthy, traveling the void in luxurious splendor. Today, everything is worn – tears and burns cover the furniture, profane graffiti the mosaics. On the lower decks, everything is simple and crude, made from metal and rubber, and dark, dirty, and decrepit. Despite years of neglect, the Ghazali is more or less functional – a testament to the quality of the work of the Alkarra docks that constructed the ship some thirty cycles ago.</p><p>The liner had been taken out of service and was rusting in a dockyard when the distress call reached Coriolis. The owners, Exeter, were leaning toward scrapping the ship and selling it for parts rather than spending the fortune required to repair and modernize it. The Ghazali was already singing its swan song when its fate was sealed by the Colonial Agency, who swiftly purchased it for their rescue mission to Taoan. The worn-out furniture was cleared out and replaced by stasis beds stacked on top of each other, covering the mosaics and the hand-woven draperies. Starlight shining through the rose tinted windows now falls on crates of stasis fluid rather than on silk sheets. To the ship’s original three hundred beds were added another two hundred, to make room for the Tsurabi crew if they had to be evacuated. Vehicles, exos, and a huge amount of other gear was brought along in the hopes that whatever had happened to the colony could be repaired on site, at least temporarily. The Colonial Agency doesn’t abandon their colonies unless all other options have failed, as it makes future recruitment that much harder.</p><p>The Ghazali is a huge vessel, and much of it is left up to you as the GM to describe to the PCs, depending on which areas they pass through (although you could, for example, describe the less important parts only briefly as the group passes through on their way to more interesting areas). The PCs will mainly use corridors or elevators when getting around. The elevator cars themselves are unreliable, and the PCs may have to climb the shafts in some areas. As a general rule, the higher decks are in better condition, and packed full of supplies and spare parts for the mining machinery. The air is dry, and more or less free from unpleasant smells. The lower decks lack any kind of decorations, and have been crammed full of stasis beds. The different areas of the liner can be seen on page 6. In the center of this booklet, you will find a floor plan of the ship that can be shown to the players to help them find their way.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/introduction/ghazalis_blueprint_small.webp\"/></div><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Hamura System</h3><p>The scenario takes place in the Hamura system, a system between Kua – where the expedition sets out from – and Taoan, its destination. @JournalEntry[06 - The Hamura System] is described on page 52.</p><h2>Main Characters</h2><p>Most of the survivors onboard the Ghazali are frightened rescue workers, suffering the effects of varying degrees of radiation poisoning. There are, however, a few individuals that are strong enough to step up and challenge decisions made by the PCs that they find immoral or questionable. These are described briefly in Table 1, and in their respective scenes.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Table 1 Characters And Motivations</h4><table><thead><tr><th>NAME</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th><th>MOTIVATION</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Khomina</td><td>Mystic with a vision</td><td>Getting the rest of the survivors to give up and accept their fate</td></tr><tr><td>Brother Ramas</td><td>Samaritan Fanatic</td><td>Helping the righteous among the survivors in any way he can</td></tr><tr><td>Komoro Vai</td><td>Selfish Leader</td><td>Leading the evacuation to ensure his own safety</td></tr><tr><td>Sabetha Pour</td><td>Smuggler</td><td>Saving her contraband and herself</td></tr><tr><td>Koria Yohares</td><td>Informal Leader</td><td>Helping the PCs with the evacuation (if they rescue him from the chapel)</td></tr><tr><td>Zhasai</td><td>Nekatra Alpha</td><td>Saving her pack from death onboard the Ghazali</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar\"><h5>The PCs’ Ship</h5><p>Before the jump from Kua, the captain of the Ghazali, Ia Kaschares, ordered all smaller vessels in the fleet to dock with the liner and shut off their reactors to keep traffic around the Ghazali to a minimum. The crews of the vessels were assigned stasis beds on the Ghazali for the journey. When the detonation in the portal to Taoan occurred, many of the docked ships were destroyed, but the PCs’ ship has likely survived with only minimal damage. A description of the free trader vessel Fatima’s Bounty in included on page 50 @UUID[JournalEntry.z413107241785096.JournalEntryPage.e8655bd2653c3db6#the-situation]{The Escape Vessel - The Situation}. It might come in handy as an escape ship if the PCs are without a ship of their own for some reason.</p></div><h2>Factions And Groups</h2><p>The Last Voyage of the Ghazali is a high octane race against time, with little room for political intrigue. Some of the NPCs in the scenario are affiliated with the factions of the Third Horizon, but the desperate situation means everyone prioritizes survival over ideology. The exception here is Samaritan Brother Ramas, from the Order of the Pariah. He is zealously devoted to the Zalosian way, and will act accordingly, no matter the cost.</p><p>The rescue mission is organized and funded by the Colonial Agency, which, by extension, means the Consortium. Saving lives and valuable data from the Ghazali will be rewarded by the faction, and actions to the contrary will be punished.</p><h2>Before You Begin</h2><p>This section contains tips and ideas that might come in handy regardless of whether you use the doomed ship as a setting for a tweaked version of the scenario or play it strictly by the book. The floor plan at the back will help you guide the group through the dangers ahead.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Act 1</h3><p>The PCs wake up in their stasis chamber and work their way through the ship, trying to find out what has happened. The scenes in Act I are open-ended, and can be played in any order between the starting scene and the encounter with the ship’s confused central computer, Suleiman. Darkness Points can be used to put obstacles and dangers in the path of the group.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Act 2</h3><p>The hub of Act II is @UUID[JournalEntry.z413107241785096.JournalEntryPage.5165dcd9dc45b890]{The Medlab} (page 19) where several key scenes take place. From there, the PCs can head out to explore other important areas – the escape ship, the bridge, the chapel, and possibly the cargo hold.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Act 3</h3><p>The Ghazali’s reactor eventually fails and heads for a meltdown. It is time to say goodbye to the doomed liner and escape as quickly as possible.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Maps</h3><p>The maps that accompany the different scene descriptions can be useful to give your group a better sense of what their surroundings look like. You are of course free to change the location of a scene, and use a different map.</p><div class=\"coriolis-sidebar coriolis-sidebar-alt\"><h4>Maps And Time</h4><p>The picture of the Ghazali in the back should be carefully removed from the book when you begin play and shown to the players. Keep it face up so the players can’t see the floor plan on the back. When they find the functional terminal at the end of Act I (see the Status Report event), flip it over to show them the map. Place the EP tokens on the timeline on the map, and consult the Keeping Track of Time section.</p></div><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Keeping Track Of Time</h3><p>The main themes of the scenario are urgency and desperation. When the PCs interact with Suleiman – the ship’s computer – they realize that they have only eighteen hours to plan and carry out their escape. This estimate is, however, false; the reactor is quickly failing and when its impending meltdown becomes unavoidable, Suleiman updates the timeframe, giving the PCs only 57 minutes to escape! After the scene when the group is first informed of the eighteen hours, you have two alternate ways of keeping track of time as the GM: you can either make a rough estimate of how much time passes and play the Panic! event after ten hours – or whenever it feels dramatically appropriate – regardless of how far along in their escape plan the PCs are, or you can use a slightly more detailed method, measuring time by the number of scenes played.</p><p>Each scene should take about one hour to complete, including all the relevant skill checks. When the PCs are informed about the remaining eighteen hours, take the Energy Point tokens (18 pcs) from the game box and find the map of the Ghazali in the back of this book. Place the EP tokens on the circles along the upper and lower edges of the map and remove one for each hour/scene that passes. This should help you establish a sense of urgency and stress as the group becomes painfully aware of how little time they have left. You can let the outcome of certain skill checks shorten or lengthen the time necessary to complete a scene. A critical success can, for example, cut the time necessary for the scene in half, while a failure still gets the job done, but takes double the time.</p><p>After the Panic! scene, each EP token represents ten minutes. Remove all but six tokens from the timeline when the Panic! scene begins – the PCs must now escape the Ghazali as quickly as possible!</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> Radiation</h3><p>Just as the Ghazali was preparing to jump to Taoan, it was flooded with a massive burst of hard radiation that immediately killed the jump crew and wounded many of the passengers in stasis. When the PCs wake up, many areas are still heavily irradiated – see the map on page 6 – but the radiation levels in a damaged area can vary as you see fit. The rules for radiation poisoning can be found on page 99 in the Coriolis core rulebook @UUID[JournalEntry.z151543463005475.JournalEntryPage.954b55bb8afaf0fe#radiation]{Radiation}. As radiation is invisible to the naked eye, spotting a dangerous area can be hard. Have the group test survival. If they succeed, they figure out the radiation level of the area ahead before entering it. The proper equipment will give them bonus dice to roll – an environmental scanner gives a +2 for example. When exposed to radiation, their gear can also help – a protective mask or a survival mask gives them an armor rating of 1 or 2, respectively, against radiation. Armor or suits with the ‘Vacuum suit’ feature protect against all radiation.</p><h3><span class=\"cli\"></span> The Group</h3><p>Why are the PCs aboard the Ghazali? They have signed up for the rescue mission to Tsurabi, and have been promised a substantial amount of money on return, but it may not be their only motivation. Their patron and a wide range of ulterior motives dressed up as heroism could help explain why they are here. Another important question regards their willingness to remain onboard the liner after an escape route has been identified. Will they save themselves as quickly as possible, or risk death to help out their fellow passengers? An important factor to consider is that their own ship’s computer is undergoing a lengthy reconfiguration (exactly how lengthy is up to the GM to decide). This may force them to explore other escape routes rather than just running to their ship as soon as they wake. Fatima’s Bounty is an alternative way to safety, but the competition for space aboard the ship will quickly become fierce.</p><p>As the GM, you can use DP to challenge the PCs and force them to remain on the Ghazali – for example, deciding that Fatima’s Bounty has to undergo reconfiguration just like the PCs’ ship. If the group figures out some incredibly clever way to escape immediately, however – let them. They will live to fight another day but will have to carry the burden of having left the rest of the survivors to die. Such a choice could have interesting consequences in the future. Maybe the group become wanted by the law for their cowardice, hounded by Bulletin correspondents, or tracked by shady faction investigators examining the fate of the rescue mission. A GM with a mean streak could even decide that the official blame for the incident is put on the PCs. Regardless, if they escape without trying to save the rest of the survivors, it should generate a substantial amount of DP. Below is a list of suggested reasons for different groups to have joined the rescue mission:</p><p><strong>Free traders</strong>: Many companies have invested heavily in the operation for their reputations’ sake, and will want to send representatives along to monitor their investments. The group might also have been hired by their patron to protect or salvage an important investment on the Tsurabi colony.</p><p><strong>Mercenaries</strong>: The fact that the Legion supplies an escort confirms that the Agency suspects danger on arrival in Taoan. Besides being trained in combat, mercenaries are also used to following orders, and that quality will likely come in handy at the destination, even if there is no one to fight.</p><p><strong>Explorers</strong>: Explorers are always welcome on operations such as this one. Their motivations for participating can vary – birr, fame, or previous connections to Taoan. If a PC has Taoan origins, it is not unlikely that fear for the safety of friends or relatives plays a part in their decision to participate in the mission. The fate of the Tsurabi colony is also breaking news for the Bulletin. Both official correspondents and freelancers flock to the Ghazali to be close to the action. Traveling with the rescue workers will provide a poignant portrait of modern heroism, but many of the journalists would probably prefer to dine with the captain and observe the operation from the bridge. You can’t always get what you want, however.</p><p><strong>Agents</strong>: Many groups and factions are interested in finding out what actually happened in Taoan. Since the Portal Wars, losing contact with colonies of this size has been rare. Consortium agents onboard are more or less open about their affiliation, but other factions have reasons to remain more discreet. The Hegemony are always keen on keeping up with the Consortium, and several of the Firstcome factions may find it useful to send spies along to gather data. The Colonial Agency might also have hired infiltrators to pose as rescue workers to keep an eye on the involvement of other parties.</p><p><strong>Pilgrims</strong>: Both the crew of the Ghazali and the Tsurabians will undoubtedly have need of Iconic guidance, so what better to bring along than good old guardians of the faith? The group could have been ordered to take part in the mission by their spiritual leader or guide.</p><div class=\"coreCenteredImageContainer\"><img src=\"modules/coriolis-ghazali/images/introduction/upp i skeppet03.webp\"/></div></div></div></div>"},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"coriolis-ghazali":{"importPath":"JournalEntry/01 - Introduction","noteRef":"ghaz_intro"},"yzecoriolis":{"customJournal":true}}}]}
