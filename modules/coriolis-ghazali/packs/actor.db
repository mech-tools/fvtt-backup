One of her employers, Emos Korinth, hired her to smuggle a couple of large boxes to the Uharu portal in the Taoan system. After a judicator picked up her scent, Sabetha went underground to shake the heat, but Emos interpreted this as Sabetha had tried to con him, and he tracked her down with unnerving efficiency. To make matters worse, Emos turned out to be a frontman for one of the Syndicate families on Coriolis. He gave her a second chance, however, and she saw the rescue operation as the perfect cover and her path to redemption. A free trader captain named Komoro Vai was paid to make a quick detour to the Uharu portal once the Ghazali reached Taoan, and the cargo was brought onboard the liner. Sabetha is desperately worried about the cargo falling into the wrong the hands or being destroyed along with the liner. This would certainly extinguish all hope of making up for past mistakes with the Syndicate, and she would be as good as dead.</p><p><strong>APPEARANCE</strong>: A confident woman in her prime.
