As a direct descendant of the Zenith, she takes great pride in establishing the Consortium as the leading faction of peace and prosperity in the Third Horizon. She got her own command on the research vessel Gyaan V early in her career, but after a couple of failed expeditions, her funding was cut. It wasn’t until her father managed to stumble over some hard-earned information about the outer systems, that things changed. From the lips of a dying archaeologist, poisoned by radiation after a terrible accident near the Eanu portal, Jarouma found out about the possible activation of the Web of Izar.

Birr have been heavily invested into her projects, by investors not only from within the Foundation or the prospecting branch of the Consortium. She has also done a fair amount of shady deals with Syndicate and Free League representatives in order to cover up the fact that she has been skimming funds for her own, non-sanctioned projects.

Her family is one of the older ones on Menau, the third and farthest star of the Mira tri-star system. Isolated at the far reaches of the system, Harish became anxious to leave and explore. Once she was of age, she signed up as deckhand on a freighter. Finding a lover on the space docks, Harish signed on for a hard-labor position aboard a local prospecting ship, taking her further out into the Third Horizon. After a fatal accident somewhere deep within the debris belt of Yastapol, she returned, alone, to civilization. She left the space-faring life behind and went to university, studying archaeology.

The elders spoke of the great war, the conflict that finally led to the exodus of the Mogul fleet. Since he was a child, he has traveled the star systems of the Third Horizon. He studies interactions between factions and systems, seeking answers and portents of things to come. A man of few words, but friendly, observant, and devoted.</p><p><strong>CHARACTERISTICS</strong>: Yorûg is both empathic and analytical. He touches the shoulder of someone in need, or holds them to release stress. He is the one most devoted to the Icons, praying regularly.</p><p><strong>PERSONAL PROBLEM</strong>: Yorûg is devoted. When fear and doubt strikes he has to pray to the Icons.</p><p><strong>SCENARIO GOAL</strong>: Yorûg is the instrument sent forth to secure the arrival of the Emissaries. He will do anything to keep the ship and the crew on Xene long enough for the portal to open. This will at first be through manipulation, seeking like-minded supporters, like the religious Alam – but he has also rigged explosive charges within the ship which can be remote-detonated through a dead man’s switch if his hand is forced. When activated, the explosives will ground the ship, or make it drop into a slow descent into Xene’s atmosphere.

The First Horizon have been harnessing energy from the great darkness for many centuries. The use of their powers to torture and kill the Emissary permanently corrupted the area around the hospital, creating a tear in reality. If living matter approaches the tear, the darkness on the other side can push through the crack. Ayaam’sha has not been seen in the Third Horizon before and only ancient Mogul texts mention the shapeless shadow in references to the previous Horizons’ Exile Wars.</p><p><strong>APPEARANCE</strong>: Ayaam’sha is a two-dimensional being, consisting of strings or flaps of darkness assuming physical form. They bend and twist around each other to form a three-dimensional body. Light bends around the creature, making it appear as complete darkness with shimmering edges. The being is hollow, and the flaps can be rearranged to be closer or farther apart, enabling it to change in size from a one-dimensional dot to a cloud as large as a house.</p><p><strong>CHARACTERISTICS</strong>: When the creature materializes, the pressure in the surrounding area is affected – powerful winds come out of nowhere and people usually experience ear pain, headaches, and nosebleeds. The being makes no sound, but it makes its victims hear their own fear and anxiety as a hissing, sickening breath coming from the creature.</p><p><strong>ABILITIES</strong>: The darkmorph has no attributes or skills, instead only using its abilities. It can be damaged by sharp melee weapons, fire and explosions, as well as by non-traditional firearms such as thermal and Vulcan weapons. There are ancient rituals that banish Ayaam’sha, but they are not yet known in the Third Horizon.</p><p>HIT POINTS: 10 (see Darkborn below)<br>SIZE: The creature has four different sizes that define its stats (see Size shift below).</p><ul><li><p>“One-dimensional” – unable to attack, moves two meters per action, cannot be damaged.</p></li><li><p>“Humanoid” – attacks within Close range, moves twenty meters per action, inflicts 5 points of stress, armor 3</p></li><li><p>“Small room” – attacks within Short range, moves ten meters per action, inflicts 3 points of stress, armor 6</p></li><li><p>“Large hall” – attacks within Long range, unable to move, inflicts 1 point of stress, armor 12<br>WEAPONS: see the Darken Mind ability below</p></li><li><p>DARKBORN (2 DP): As Ayaam’sha is a manifestation of pure darkness, it relies on Darkness Points for all its actions. It cannot be killed in any traditional sense of the word, and only disappears if the GM has no more DP left to spend. Critical injuries sustained are noted down, and when the creature’s HP are reduced to 0, it disappears for as many turns as the number of critical injuries suffered.

His orders have recently become more and more extreme, and although he views the operation as more or less successful, he can feel his power over the strike team slipping through his fingers. Chabaun has started to suspect him, and he fears for his life. He keeps a thermal cricket ready under his robes at all times and desperately looks for a chance to signal his employers for extraction before it is too late.</p><p><strong>APPEARANCE</strong>: A weary-looking man with a well-kept mustache and a jewelled beard. A small piece of wood is fastened through the skin just below his lower lip. Bald and with fake facial tattoos. He wears a caftan with religious, Zalosian patterns covered with many layers of expensive shawls around his torso.</p><p><strong>CHARACTERISTICS</strong>: Tries to act calm, but looks around nervously and sweats a lot.

When the current operation was launched, he was appointed head of the strike team and elevated to Priot by his uncle, Khaleem Hydarnes, who understood the need for firm leadership during such a difficult assignment. The Warriors of the Holy Light adhere to a very literal interpretation of Iria Urahuk’s Statutes – a collection of prophecies warning about the return of darkness to the Horizon as well as describing the sacraments necessary to cleanse the world from evil. The radical beliefs and methods of the strike team differ so much from those of the rest of the Order that they have been shunned by the faction and are classified as a splinter group. Chabaun has always loved poetry, and dedicates what little free time he has to sacral poems and ancient prose.

Leod’s grandmother worked together with Algolan slavers to hunt down and capture Krahin humanites in the Marfik system. Business was booming as the construction of the Coriolis station and much of the early heavy industry around the Monolith wore out slaves faster than they could be replaced. Leod’s father was less successful however, and lost much of his inherited business around the Conglomerate, to the point where he was no longer welcome to trade in Covenant City. When Leod assumed the title of dar and head of the family, he took it upon himself to make up for his father’s mistakes and get back on the Monolitheans’ good side. By cooperating with the Birbasils, he gradually took over Little Algol, out-maneuvering the Algolan slavers who used to run the district. His pursuit of Zenithian acceptance led him to renounce his Dabaran origins and change his name to the more suitable dol-Quassar. Leod’s operation in Little Algol is virtually unchallenged, and he makes an enormous profit from the slave trade he runs with the help of both the Syndicate and several smaller, independent groups. He knows many dirty secrets about important people in the Monolith, which has enabled him to orchestrate the marriage of his only son to the fifth daughter of Aedon Din Hrama.</p><p><strong>APPEARANCE</strong>: Thin and somewhat weary-looking, dressed in expensive silk clothing and with Zenithian face paint closely modelled on the patterns used by the Quassar clan.</p><p><strong>CHARACTERISTICS</strong>: Looks around anxiously and scratches his left arm when nervous.</p>","radiation":{"max":10,"min":0,"value":0},"reputation":{"max":10,"min":0,"value":7},"skills":{"command":{"attribute":"empathy","category":"advanced","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","max":5,"min":0,"value":2},"culture":{"attribute":"empathy","category":"advanced","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","max":5,"min":0,"value":5},"datadjinn":{"attribute":"wits","category":"advanced","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","max":5,"min":0,"value":0},"dexterity":{"attribute":"agility","category":"general","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","max":5,"min":0,"value":0},"force":{"attribute":"strength","category":"general","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","max":5,"min":0,"value":0},"infiltration":{"attribute":"agility","category":"general","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","max":5,"min":0,"value":0},"manipulation":{"attribute":"empathy","category":"general","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","max":5,"min":0,"value":4},"medicurgy":{"attribute":"wits","category":"advanced","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","max":5,"min":0,"value":0},"meleecombat":{"attribute":"strength","category":"general","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","max":5,"min":0,"value":0},"mysticpowers":{"attribute":"empathy","category":"advanced","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","max":5,"min":0,"value":0},"observation":{"attribute":"wits","category":"general","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","max":5,"min":0,"value":0},"pilot":{"attribute":"agility","category":"advanced","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","max":5,"min":0,"value":0},"rangedcombat":{"attribute":"agility","category":"general","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","max":5,"min":0,"value":0},"science":{"attribute":"wits","category":"advanced","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","max":5,"min":0,"value":1},"survival":{"attribute":"wits","category":"general","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","max":5,"min":0,"value":0},"technology":{"attribute":"wits","category":"advanced","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","max":5,"min":0,"value":0}}},"type":"npc"}

As long as Ahuro is sober, he also possesses a trait not found in your average member of the Guard: competence. In this scenario, Ahuro takes half-hearted charge of the Guard&rsquo;s investigation into the murdered and missing mystics. This turns into a rather complicated affair thanks to the fact that Ahuro himself is a mystic and could end up on the martyr strike team&rsquo;s death list if he isn&rsquo;t careful. The disease manifests itself in that his mind wanders from his body when he sleeps. He first believed this to be just a series of vivid nightmares, until he “walked in” on his neighbor engaging in some extramarital activities. He has since learned to keep his power in check by drinking himself to sleep.<br>Since his days as a patrolling guardsman in the Mulukhad and his subsequent position as head of the fearsome “Kneecappers” squadron, Ahuro is known as a brutal, greedy, and cunning lawman who is more than willing to look the other way as long as there is birr to be made. If he is confronted with the fact of his disease, he just might have a change of heart and become a valuable ally in the PCs&rsquo; investigation – or he might try to drown his sorrows in kohôl and take out his aggressions on some unlucky street thug (or an annoyingly inquisitive PC).
