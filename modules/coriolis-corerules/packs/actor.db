Many rebels and opor farmers have succumbed to the jayrat when an unkindness, a large flock of the creatures, dives towards them from above, covering them in darkness and leaving only bones behind. Jayrats are described as raven-like creatures that in large numbers seem to melt into a moving cloud of darkness. With their beaks and talons they attack all living things in their path. Stories about them also suggest that they are drawn to gravitational phenomena, both on planets and in space.</p><div class=\"blueheader\">Special Abilities</div><ul><li><strong>SWARM</strong>: The jayrat swarm can only be damaged by flame and thermal throwers or explosions.</li><li><strong>CLOAK OF SHADOWS</strong>: The jayrat swarm can spend 1 DP to cover a victim within Close Range in complete darkness.

Like many other sculpted creatures, the muzhadjar’s capabilities far exceeded the expectations of their creators. They quickly became autonomous and learned how to reproduce. Wild muzhadjar live off raw materials (both organic and inorganic) and solar radiation, restructuring it into chemical energy and fuel. The muzhadjar usually feed on ship wreckage and small asteroids but are drawn to ships in motion. They communicate using radio signals, which make them easy to detect on ship sensors (+1).

The largest known dromedons were over 7 meters high, but this is rare. Domesticated dromedons are usually put down when they reach a height of three meters.
