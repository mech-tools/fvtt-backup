One night, when the two moons of Menkar were only waning crescents in the sky, grey-white smoke suddenly sprang from the corners of all the rooms in the colony. From out of the smoke came dog-like creatures that hunted and devoured all of Tirides’ inhabitants before the sun rose again. The sole survivor hid in a round water tank and was spared thanks to that. From this story comes the Horizon tradition of building round houses in several of the outer systems. Since the Tirides incident, other colonies have also described seeing the same canine demon creatures, now called the Hounds of Tirides. The hounds manifest themselves through sharp corners as a mist of black or grey-white smoke that soon transforms into what looks like a sinewy, skinny dog or some strange bird, immediately attacking the first person it sees.

To digest the chewy vegetation, their stomachs have eight compartments, which unfortunately means they pass quite a lot of methane through their rear ends. Zenithian colonists call the dromedons the “stinker of the desert” and many actually prefer motorized vehicles because of the smell. The dromedons are born with one hump but sometimes grow more during their life, as they never stop growing. This eventually leads to the older dromedons dying from heart failure or fractures, usually after reaching a withers height of over four meters. The largest known dromedons were over 7 meters high, but this is rare. Domesticated dromedons are usually put down when they reach a height of three meters.

The muzhadjar usually feed on ship wreckage and small asteroids but are drawn to ships in motion. They communicate using radio signals, which make them easy to detect on ship sensors (+1).

To withstand the heat, its blood flow has been extended through special skin flaps between the front and hind legs that function as an internal cooling system. The flaps can be retracted for faster movement. To be more of a challenge to hunters, the dirhad have been made intelligent (but not a true semi-intelligence) and its head and torso is covered in bionic armor that protects against most primitive weapons. “Dirhad” actually means armor or shell cat in the language of the Beri nomads.
