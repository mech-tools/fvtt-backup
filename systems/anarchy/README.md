# Welcome to Shadowrun Anarchy

If you are here, you probably know the world has changed, with technology melting with flesh, mythological creatures and magic raising back from the past.

This system implements Shadowrun Anarchy rules for Foundry VTT.

To run a game, you will need the [Shadowrun Anarchy rule book](https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/shadowrun-anarchy-pdf), edited by [Catalyst game labs](https://www.catalystgamelabs.com/).

In French, [Shadowrun - Anarchy (VF)](https://www.black-book-editions.fr/produit.php?id=6543), edited by  [Black Book Edition](https://www.black-book-editions.fr/).

## Characters

All characters and opponents are managed almost equal. You may chose different sheet (in the _Sheet_ menu on the header bar): reduced for NPCs, on one page, or with tabs.

Player-owned characters have Anarchy, while NPCs are using the gamemaster's anarchy (even if not displayed on their sheets).

The system supports all you need to play, different type of actors (character, vehicle, device, sprite, and IC), and of items (metatype, skill, qualities, shadow amps, weapons, gear and contacts).

Weapons can be used for regular weapons, for spells, and for matrix attacks (to crash or put marks on target).

Modifiers are available and impact the actual rolls they modify. They can also change monitors, resistances, manage scene anarchy (during combats).

Rolls are started by a click on the name of the weapon/skill/attribute, or on the configurable shortcuts, directly on the token.

When using a weapon, select your target, it will receive a message to defend, with a link to do the roll.

## Gamemaster

The gamemaster has access to a special window which contains:

- Gamemaster's plot points
- Typical difficulty rolls (which can be customized in system options)
- Reminder of GOD surveillance level

When a player character spends anarchy, the GM plot points are increased accordingly.
